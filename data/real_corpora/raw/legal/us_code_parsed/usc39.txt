101.Postal policy.


102.Definitions.



§ 101. Postal policy(a) The United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States, authorized by the Constitution, created by Act of Congress, and supported by the people. The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities. The costs of establishing and maintaining the Postal Service shall not be apportioned to impair the overall value of such service to the people.

(b) The Postal Service shall maintain an integrated network for the delivery of market-dominant and competitive products (as defined in chapter 36 of this title). Delivery shall occur at least six days a week, except during weeks that include a Federal holiday, in emergency situations, such as natural disasters, or in geographic areas where the Postal Service has established a policy of delivering mail fewer than six days a week as of the date of enactment of the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. The Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. No small post office shall be closed solely for operating at a deficit, it being the specific intent of the Congress that effective postal services be insured to residents of both urban and rural communities.

(c) As an employer, the Postal Service shall achieve and maintain compensation for its officers and employees comparable to the rates and types of compensation paid in the private sector of the economy of the United States. It shall place particular emphasis upon opportunities for career advancements of all officers and employees and the achievement of worthwhile and satisfying careers in the service of the United States.

(d) Postal rates shall be established to apportion the costs of all postal operations to all users of the mail on a fair and equitable basis.

(e) In determining all policies for postal services, the Postal Service shall give the highest consideration to the requirement for the most expeditious collection, transportation, and delivery of important letter mail.

(f) In selecting modes of transportation, the Postal Service shall give highest consideration to the prompt, economical, consistent, and reliable delivery of all mail in a manner that increases operational efficiency and reduces complexity. Modern methods of transporting mail by containerization and programs designed to achieve cost-effective overnight transportation to the destination of important letter mail to all parts of the Nation shall also be a primary goal of postal operations.

(g) In planning and building new postal facilities, the Postal Service shall emphasize the need for facilities and equipment designed to create desirable working conditions for its officers and employees, a maximum degree of convenience for efficient postal services, proper access to existing and future air and surface transportation facilities, and control of costs to the Postal Service.

(2) to prescribe, in accordance with this title, the amount of postage and the manner in which it is to be paid;

(3) to determine the need for post offices, postal and training facilities and equipment, and to provide such offices, facilities, and equipment as it determines are needed;

(4) to provide and sell postage stamps and other stamped paper, cards, and envelopes and to provide such other evidences of payment of postage and fees as may be necessary or desirable;

(5) to provide philatelic services;

(6) to investigate postal offenses and civil matters relating to the Postal Service;

(7) to offer and pay rewards for information and services in connection with violation of the postal laws, and, unless a different disposal is expressly prescribed, to pay one-half of all penalties and forfeitures imposed for violations of law affecting the Postal Service, its revenues, or property, to the person informing for the same, and to pay the other one-half into the Postal Service Fund; and

(8) to authorize the issuance of a substitute check for a lost, stolen, or destroyed check of the Postal Service.


(b) Except as otherwise provided, the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail and reasonable and equitable rates of postage and fees for postal services in accordance with the provisions of chapter 36. Postal rates and fees shall be reasonable and equitable and sufficient to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.

(c) The Postal Service shall maintain one or more classes of mail for the transmission of letters sealed against inspection. The rate for each such class shall be uniform throughout the United States, its territories, and possessions. One such class shall provide for the most expeditious handling and transportation afforded mail matter by the Postal Service. No letter of such a class of domestic origin shall be opened except under authority of a search warrant authorized by law, or by an officer or employee of the Postal Service for the sole purpose of determining an address at which the letter can be delivered, or pursuant to the authorization of the addressee.

(d)(1) The Postal Service, prior to making a determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section as to the necessity for the closing or consolidation of any post office, shall provide adequate notice of its intention to close or consolidate such post office at least 60 days prior to the proposed date of such closing or consolidation to persons served by such post office to ensure that such persons will have an opportunity to present their views.

(2) The Postal Service, in making a determination whether or not to close or consolidate a post office—(A) shall consider—(i) the effect of such closing or consolidation on the community served by such post office;

(ii) the effect of such closing or consolidation on employees of the Postal Service employed at such office;

(iii) whether such closing or consolidation is consistent with the policy of the Government, as stated in section 101(b) of this title, that the Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining;

(iv) the economic savings to the Postal Service resulting from such closing or consolidation; and

(v) such other factors as the Postal Service determines are necessary; and


(B) may not consider compliance with any provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.).


(3) Any determination of the Postal Service to close or consolidate a post office shall be in writing and shall include the findings of the Postal Service with respect to the considerations required to be made under paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such determination and findings shall be made available to persons served by such post office.

(4) The Postal Service shall take no action to close or consolidate a post office until 60 days after its written determination is made available to persons served by such post office.

The Commission shall review such determination on the basis of the record before the Postal Service in the making of such determination. The Commission shall make a determination based upon such review no later than 120 days after receiving any appeal under this paragraph.

(B) without observance of procedure required by law; or

(C) unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.


The Commission may affirm the determination of the Postal Service or order that the entire matter be returned for further consideration, but the Commission may not modify the determination of the Postal Service. The Commission may suspend the effectiveness of the determination of the Postal Service until the final disposition of the appeal. The provisions of section 556, section 557, and chapter 7 of title 5 shall not apply to any review carried out by the Commission under this paragraph.

(6) For purposes of paragraph (5), any appeal received by the Commission shall—(A) if sent to the Commission through the mails, be considered to have been received on the date of the Postal Service postmark on the envelope or other cover in which such appeal is mailed; or

(B) if otherwise lawfully delivered to the Commission, be considered to have been received on the date determined based on any appropriate documentation or other indicia (as determined under regulations of the Commission).



(e)(1) In this subsection, the term “nonpostal service” means any service that is not a postal service defined under section 102(5).

(2) Nothing in this section shall be considered to permit or require that the Postal Service provide any nonpostal service, except that the Postal Service may provide nonpostal services which were offered as of January 1, 2006, as provided under this subsection, or any nonpostal products or services authorized by chapter 37.

(3) Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall review each nonpostal service offered by the Postal Service on the date of enactment of that Act and determine whether that nonpostal service shall continue, taking into account—(A) the public need for the service; and

(B) the ability of the private sector to meet the public need for the service.


(4) Any nonpostal service not determined to be continued by the Postal Regulatory Commission under paragraph (3) shall terminate.

Executive Documents

Modernizing the Monetary Reimbursement Model for the Delivery of Goods Through the International Postal System and Enhancing the Security and Safety of International Mail
Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 23, 2018, 83 F.R. 47791, provided:
Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the Postmaster General[, and] the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Definitions. (a) “Good” means any tangible and movable object that can be conveyed by the international postal system, excluding (i) written, drawn, printed, or digital information recorded on a tangible medium that is not an object of merchandise and (ii) money.
(b) “Non-postal operator” means a private express carrier, freight forwarder, or other provider of services for the collection, transportation, and delivery of international documents and packages, other than a postal operator.
(c) “Postal operator” means a governmental or non-governmental entity officially designated by a Universal Postal Union (UPU) member country to operate postal services and to fulfill the related obligations arising out of the Acts of the UPU on its territory.
(d) “Terminal dues” means the rates or fees determined through the UPU and paid by the postal operator in the country of origin to the postal operator in the country of destination to compensate for costs incurred in the country of destination for processing, transportation, and delivery of international “letter post” items, which may include documents or goods and generally weigh up to 4.4 pounds.
Sec. 2. Policy. (a) The UPU was established in 1874 by 21 countries. The United States played an integral role in the UPU’s creation and, since that time, the United States has actively participated in all phases of the UPU’s work. The United States is a party to the current Constitution of the UPU—which was adopted in 1964—and intends to continue to participate fully in and financially contribute to the UPU, as provided in Article 21 of the UPU Constitution. As a member country of the UPU, the United States recognizes the importance of this long-standing organization and is proud of the United States’ unbroken record of participation in it.
The Congress has provided that the Secretary of State (Secretary), in concluding postal treaties, conventions, or other international agreements, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, take measures to encourage governments of other countries to make available to the United States Postal Service (USPS) and private companies a range of nondiscriminatory customs procedures that will fully meet the needs of all types of American shippers (39 U.S.C. 407(e)(3)).
The Congress has likewise directed that responsible officials shall apply the customs laws of the United States and all other laws relating to importation or exportation of goods in the same manner to shipments of goods that are competitive products of the USPS and to similar shipments by private companies (39 U.S.C. 407(e)(2)).
It is the policy of the United States to promote and encourage the development of an efficient and competitive global system that provides for fair and nondiscriminatory postal rates.
(b) It is in the interest of the United States to:
(i) promote and encourage communications between peoples by efficient operation of international postal services and other international delivery services for cultural, social, and economic purposes (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(1));
(ii) promote and encourage unrestricted and undistorted competition in the provision of international postal services and other international delivery services, except where provision of such services by private companies may be prohibited by the laws of the United States (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(2));
(iii) promote and encourage a clear distinction between governmental and operational responsibilities with respect to the provision of international postal services and other international delivery services by the Government of the United States and by intergovernmental organizations of which the United States is a member (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(3)); and
(iv) participate in multilateral and bilateral agreements with other countries to accomplish these objectives (39 U.S.C. 407(a)(4)).
(c) Some current international postal practices in the UPU do not align with United States economic and national security interests:
(i) UPU terminal dues, in many cases, are less than comparable domestic postage rates. As a result:
(A) the United States, along with other member countries of the UPU, is in many cases not fully reimbursed by the foreign postal operator for the cost of delivering foreign-origin letter post items, which can result in substantial preferences for foreign mailers relative to domestic mailers;
(B) the current terminal dues rates undermine the goal of unrestricted and undistorted competition in cross-border delivery services because they disadvantage non-postal operators seeking to offer competing collection and outward transportation services for goods covered by terminal dues in foreign markets; and
(C) the current system of terminal dues distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the shipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates.
(ii) The UPU has not done enough to reorient international mail to achieve a clear distinction between documents and goods. Without such a distinction, it is difficult to achieve essential pricing reforms or to ensure that customs requirements, including provision of electronic customs data for goods, are met. Under the current system, foreign postal operators do not uniformly furnish advance electronic customs data that are needed to enhance targeting and risk management for national security and to facilitate importation and customs clearance. My Administration’s Initiative to Stop Opioids Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, launched in March of this year [2018], requires accurate advance electronic customs data for 90 percent of all international mail shipments that contain goods and consignment shipments within 3 years, so that the Department of Homeland Security can better detect and flag high-risk shipments.
(d) It shall be the policy of the executive branch to support efforts that further the policies in this memorandum, including supporting a system of unrestricted and undistorted competition between United States and foreign merchants. Such efforts include:
(i) ensuring that rates charged for delivery of foreign-origin mail containing goods do not favor foreign mailers over domestic mailers;
(ii) setting rates charged for delivery of foreign-origin mail in a manner that does not favor postal operators over non-postal operators; and
(iii) ensuring the collection of advance electronic customs data.
Sec. 3. Relations with the UPU. (a) The United States must seek reforms to the UPU that promote the policies outlined in this memorandum. Such reforms shall provide for:
(i) a system of fair and nondiscriminatory rates for goods that promotes unrestricted and undistorted competition; and
(ii) terminal dues rates that:
(A) fully reimburse the USPS for costs to the same extent as domestic rates for comparable services;
(B) avoid a preference for inbound foreign small packages containing goods that favors foreign mailers over domestic mailers; and
(C) avoid a preference for inbound foreign small packages containing goods that favors postal operators over private-sector entities providing transportation services.
(b) If negotiations at the UPU’s September 2018 Second Extraordinary Congress in Ethiopia fail to yield reforms that satisfy the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the United States will consider taking any appropriate actions to ensure that rates for the delivery of inbound foreign packages satisfy those criteria, consistent with applicable law.
Sec. 4. Actions by the Secretary. (a) The Secretary shall notify the Director General of the UPU of the policies and intentions of the United States described in this memorandum.
(b) The Secretary or his designee shall, consistent with 39 U.S.C. 407(b)(1), seek agreement on future Convention texts that comport with the policies of this memorandum in meetings of the UPU, including at the September 2018 Extraordinary Congress.
(c) No later than November 1, 2018, the Secretary shall submit to the President a report summarizing the steps being taken to implement this memorandum. If the Secretary determines that sufficient progress on reforms to promote compatibility of the Acts of the UPU with the policy of this memorandum is not being achieved, the Secretary shall include recommendations for future action, including the possibility of adopting self-declared rates.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(d) The Secretary is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Donald J. Trump.

(2) Within 15 days after receiving a request under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall provide a list of 7 individuals recognized as experts in supervisory and managerial pay policies.

The first two individuals designated from the list shall meet within 5 days and shall designate a third individual from the list. The third individual shall chair the panel. If the two individuals designated from the list are unable to designate a third individual within 5 days after their first meeting, the Director shall designate the third individual.

(B) if 2 or more postmasters’ organizations exist, by treating such organizations as if they constituted a single organization, in accordance with such arrangements as such organizations shall mutually agree to.


(2) If 2 or more postmasters’ organizations exist, such organizations shall, in the case of any factfinding panel convened at the request of such organizations (in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)), be jointly and severally liable for the cost of such panel, apart from the portion to be borne by the Postal Service (as determined under subsection (f)(4)).

(4) such other matters as the committees may determine necessary to ensure that the Congress is fully and currently consulted and informed on postal operations, plans, and policies.


Each year, the Postal Service shall appear before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives to submit information which any such committee considers necessary to determine the amount of funds to be appropriated for the operation of the Postal Service, and to present testimony and respond to questions with respect to such budget and statement. Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.

(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.

(b) Upon receipt of notice from an addressee that he has received such mail matter, determined by the addressee in his sole discretion to be of the character described in subsection (a) of this section, the Postal Service shall issue an order, if requested by the addressee, to the sender thereof, directing the sender and his agents or assigns to refrain from further mailings to the named addressees.

(e) Any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which any mail matter shall have been sent or received in violation of the order provided for by this section shall have jurisdiction, upon application by the Attorney General, to issue an order commanding compliance with such notice.

§ 3010. Mailing of sexually oriented advertisements(a) Any person who mails or causes to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement shall place on the envelope or cover thereof his name and address as the sender thereof and such mark or notice as the Postal Service may prescribe.

(b) Any person, on his own behalf or on the behalf of any of his children who has not attained the age of 19 years and who resides with him or is under his care, custody, or supervision, may file with the Postal Service a statement, in such form and manner as the Postal Service may prescribe, that he desires to receive no sexually oriented advertisements through the mails. The Postal Service shall maintain and keep current, insofar as practicable, a list of the names and addresses of such persons and shall make the list (including portions thereof or changes therein) available to any person, upon such reasonable terms and conditions as it may prescribe, including the payment of such service charge as it determines to be necessary to defray the cost of compiling and maintaining the list and making it available as provided in this sentence.

Invasion of Privacy by Mailing of Sexually Oriented AdvertisementsPub. L. 91–375, § 14, Aug. 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 786, provided that:
“(a) [Congressional findings] The Congress finds—“(1) that the United States mails are being used for the indiscriminate dissemination of advertising matter so designed and so presented as to exploit sexual sensationalism for commercial gain;

“(2) that such matter is profoundly shocking and offensive to many persons who receive it, unsolicited, through the mails;

“(3) that such use of the mails constitutes a serious threat to the dignity and sanctity of the American home and subjects many persons to an unconscionable and unwarranted intrusion upon their fundamental personal right to privacy;

“(4) that such use of the mail reduces the ability of responsible parents to protect their minor children from exposure to material which they as parents believe to be harmful to the normal and healthy ethical, mental, and social development of their children; and

“(5) that the traffic in such offensive advertisements is so large that individual citizens will be helpless to protect their privacy or their families without stronger and more effective Federal controls over the mailing of such matter.


“(b) [Congressional Determination of Public Policy] On the basis of such findings, the Congress determines that it is contrary to the public policy of the United States for the facilities and services of the United States Postal Service to be used for the distribution of such materials to persons who do not want their privacy invaded in this manner or to persons who wish to protect their minor children from exposure to such material.”



[Provisions of section 14 of Pub. L. 91–375 effective within 1 year after Aug. 12, 1970, on date established therefor by the Board of Governors and published by it in the Federal Register, see section 15(a) of Pub. L. 91–375, set out as an Effective Date not preceding section 101 of this title.]



§ 3011. Judicial enforcement(a) Whenever the Postal Service believes that any person is mailing or causing to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement in violation of section 3010 of this title, it may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action against such person in a district court of the United States. Upon a finding by the court of a violation of that section, the court may issue an order including one or more of the following provisions as the court deems just under the circumstances:(1) a direction to the defendant to refrain from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to a specific addressee, to any group of addressees, or to all persons;

(2) a direction to any postmaster to whom sexually oriented advertisements originating with such defendant are tendered for transmission through the mails to refuse to accept such advertisements for mailing; or

(3) a direction to any postmaster at the office at which registered or certified letters or other letters or mail arrive, addressed to the defendant or his representative, to return the registered or certified letters or other letters or mail to the sender appropriately marked as being in response to mail in violation of section 3010 of this title, after the defendant, or his representative, has been notified and given reasonable opportunity to examine such letters or mail and to obtain delivery of mail which is clearly not connected with activity alleged to be in violation of section 3010 of this title.


(b) The statement that remittances may be made to a person named in a sexually oriented advertisement is prima facie evidence that such named person is the principal, agent, or representative of the mailer for the receipt of remittances on his behalf. The court is not precluded from ascertaining the existence of the agency on the basis of any other evidence.

(c) In preparation for, or during the pendency of, a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, a district court of the United States, upon application therefor by the Attorney General and upon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction containing such terms as the court deems just, including, but not limited to, provisions enjoining the defendant from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to any person or class of persons, directing any postmaster to refuse to accept such defendant’s sexually oriented advertisements for mailing, and directing the detention of the defendant’s incoming mail by any postmaster pending the conclusion of the judicial proceedings. Any action taken by a court under this subsection does not affect or determine any fact at issue in any other proceeding under this section.

(d) A civil action under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in any judicial district in which any sexually oriented advertisement mailed in violation of section 3010 has been delivered by mail according to the direction thereon.

(e) Nothing in this section or in section 3010 shall be construed as amending, preempting, limiting, modifying, or otherwise in any way affecting section 1461 or 1463 of title 18 or section 3007 or 3008 of this title.

(2) In any proceeding in which the Postal Service assesses penalties under this subsection the Postal Service shall determine the civil penalty taking into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations of section 3005(a), and with respect to the violator, the ability to pay the penalty, the effect of the penalty on the ability of the violator to conduct lawful business, any history of prior violations of such section, the degree of culpability and other such matters as justice may require.

Modern rate regulation(a) Authority Generally.—The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products.

(b) Objectives.—Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:(1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

(2) To create predictability and stability in rates.

(3) To maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.

(4) To allow the Postal Service pricing flexibility.

(5) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.

(6) To reduce the administrative burden and increase the transparency of the ratemaking process.

(7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.

(8) To establish and maintain a just and reasonable schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.

(9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products.


(c) Factors.—In establishing or revising such system, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall take into account—(1) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;

(2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service through reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;

(3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;

(4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;

(5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;

(6) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;

(7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage increased mail volume and operational efficiency;

(8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;

(9) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;

(10) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal Service and postal users, when available on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers, that—(A) either—(i) improve the net financial position of the Postal Service through reducing Postal Service costs or increasing the overall contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service; or

(ii) enhance the performance of mail preparation, processing, transportation, or other functions; and


(B) do not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace.


(11) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;

(12) the need for the Postal Service to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;

(13) the value to the Postal Service and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and

(14) the policies of this title as well as such other factors as the Commission determines appropriate.


(d) Requirements.—(1) In general.—The system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products shall—(A) include an annual limitation on the percentage changes in rates to be set by the Postal Regulatory Commission that will be equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recent available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files notice of its intention to increase rates;

(B) establish a schedule whereby rates, when necessary and appropriate, would change at regular intervals by predictable amounts;

(C) not later than 45 days before the implementation of any adjustment in rates under this section, including adjustments made under subsection (c)(10)—(i) require the Postal Service to provide public notice of the adjustment;

(ii) provide an opportunity for review by the Postal Regulatory Commission;

(iii) provide for the Postal Regulatory Commission to notify the Postal Service of any noncompliance of the adjustment with the limitation under subparagraph (A); and

(iv) require the Postal Service to respond to the notice provided under clause (iii) and describe the actions to be taken to comply with the limitation under subparagraph (A);


(D) establish procedures whereby the Postal Service may adjust rates not in excess of the annual limitations under subparagraph (A); and

(E) notwithstanding any limitation set under subparagraphs (A) and (C), and provided there is not sufficient unused rate authority under paragraph (2)(C), establish procedures whereby rates may be adjusted on an expedited basis due to either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, provided that the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing and comment, and within 90 days after any request by the Postal Service, that such adjustment is reasonable and equitable and necessary to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.


(2) Limitations.—(A) Classes of mail.—Except as provided under subparagraph (C), the annual limitations under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to a class of mail, as defined in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule as in effect on the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.

(B) Rounding of rates and fees.—Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Postal Service from rounding rates and fees to the nearest whole integer, if the effect of such rounding does not cause the overall rate increase for any class to exceed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

(C) Use of unused rate authority.—(i) Definition.—In this subparagraph, the term “unused rate adjustment authority” means the difference between—(I) the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and

(II) the amount of the rate adjustment the Postal Service actually makes in that year.


(ii) Authority.—Subject to clause (iii), the Postal Service may use any unused rate adjustment authority for any of the 5 years following the year such authority occurred.

(iii) Limitations.—In exercising the authority under clause (ii) in any year, the Postal Service—(I) may use unused rate adjustment authority from more than 1 year;

(II) may use any part of the unused rate adjustment authority from any year;

(III) shall use the unused rate adjustment authority from the earliest year such authority first occurred and then each following year; and

(IV) for any class or service, may not exceed the annual limitation under paragraph (1) by more than 2 percentage points.




(3) Review.—Ten years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and as appropriate thereafter, the Commission shall review the system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products established under this section to determine if the system is achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c). If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the system is not achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c), the Commission may, by regulation, make such modification or adopt such alternative system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as necessary to achieve the objectives.


(e) Workshare Discounts.—(1) Definition.—In this subsection, the term “workshare discount” refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a).

(2) Scope.—The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless—(A) the discount is—(i) associated with a new postal service, a change to an existing postal service, or with a new work share initiative related to an existing postal service; and

(ii) necessary to induce mailer behavior that furthers the economically efficient operation of the Postal Service and the portion of the discount in excess of the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of the workshare activity will be phased out over a limited period of time;


(B) the amount of the discount above costs avoided—(i) is necessary to mitigate rate shock; and

(ii) will be phased out over time;


(C) the discount is provided in connection with subclasses of mail consisting exclusively of mail matter of educational, cultural, scientific, or informational value; or

(D) reduction or elimination of the discount would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service.


(3) Limitation.—Nothing in this subsection shall require that a work share discount be reduced or eliminated if the reduction or elimination of the discount would—(A) lead to a loss of volume in the affected category or subclass of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service from the category or subclass subject to the discount below what it otherwise would have been if the discount had not been reduced or eliminated; or

(B) result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.


(4) Report.—Whenever the Postal Service establishes a workshare discount rate, the Postal Service shall, at the time it publishes the workshare discount rate, submit to the Postal Regulatory Commission a detailed report that—(A) explains the Postal Service’s reasons for establishing the rate;

(B) sets forth the data, economic analyses, and other information relied on by the Postal Service to justify the rate; and

(C) certifies that the discount will not adversely affect rates or services provided to users of postal services who do not take advantage of the discount rate.



(f) Transition Rule.—For the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, rates and classes for market-dominant products shall remain subject to modification in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and section 407, as such provisions were last in effect before the date of enactment of this section. Proceedings initiated to consider a request for a recommended decision filed by the Postal Service during that 1-year period shall be completed in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 36 of this title and implementing regulations, as in effect before the date of enactment of this section.

(d) Duration.—(1) In general.—A market test of a product under this section may be conducted over a period of not to exceed 24 months.

(2) Extension authority.—If necessary in order to determine the feasibility or desirability of a product being tested under this section, the Postal Regulatory Commission may, upon written application of the Postal Service (filed not later than 60 days before the date as of which the testing of such product would otherwise be scheduled to terminate under paragraph (1)), extend the testing of such product for not to exceed an additional 12 months.


(e) Dollar-Amount Limitation.—(1) In general.—A product may only be tested under this section if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed $10,000,000 in any year, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (g). In carrying out the preceding sentence, the Postal Regulatory Commission may limit the amount of revenues the Postal Service may obtain from any particular geographic market as necessary to prevent market disruption (as defined under subsection (b)(2)).

(2) Exemption authority.—The Postal Regulatory Commission may, upon written application of the Postal Service, exempt the market test from the limit in paragraph (1) if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed $50,000,000 in any year, subject to subsection (g).

(f) Cancellation.—If the Postal Regulatory Commission at any time determines that a market test under this section fails, with respect to any particular product, to meet 1 or more of the requirements of this section, it may order the cancellation of the test involved or take such other action as it considers appropriate. A determination under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such procedures as the Commission shall by regulation prescribe.

(g) Adjustment for Inflation.—For purposes of each year following the year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service’s first report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a), each dollar amount contained in this section shall be adjusted by the change in the Consumer Price Index for such year (as determined under regulations of the Commission).

§ 3642. New products and transfers of products between the market-dominant and competitive categories of mail(a) In General.—Upon request of the Postal Service or users of the mails, or upon its own initiative, the Postal Regulatory Commission may change the list of market-dominant products under section 3621 and the list of competitive products under section 3631 by adding new products to the lists, removing products from the lists, or transferring products between the lists.

(b) Criteria.—All determinations by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with the following criteria:(1) The market-dominant category of products shall consist of each product in the sale of which the Postal Service exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price of such product substantially above costs, raise prices significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, without risk of losing a significant level of business to other firms offering similar products. The competitive category of products shall consist of all other products.

(2) Exclusion of products covered by postal monopoly.—A product covered by the postal monopoly shall not be subject to transfer under this section from the market-dominant category of mail.

(3) Additional considerations.—In making any decision under this section, due regard shall be given to—(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in the private sector engaged in the delivery of the product involved;

(B) the views of those who use the product involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; and

(C) the likely impact of the proposed action on small business concerns (within the meaning of section 3641(h)).



(c) Transfers of Subclasses and Other Subordinate Units Allowable.—Nothing in this title shall be considered to prevent transfers under this section from being made by reason of the fact that they would involve only some (but not all) of the subclasses or other subordinate units of the class of mail or type of postal service involved (without regard to satisfaction of minimum quantity requirements standing alone).

(d) Notification and Publication Requirements.—(1) Notification requirement.—The Postal Service shall, whenever it requests to add a product or transfer a product to a different category, file with the Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the Federal Register a notice setting out the basis for its determination that the product satisfies the criteria under subsection (b) and, in the case of a request to add a product or transfer a product to the competitive category of mail, that the product meets the regulations promulgated by the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3633. The provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with respect to any information required to be filed.

(2) Publication requirement.—The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, whenever it changes the list of products in the market-dominant or competitive category of mail, prescribe new lists of products. The revised lists shall indicate how and when any previous lists (including the lists under sections 3621 and 3631) are superseded, and shall be published in the Federal Register.


(e) Prohibition.—Except as provided in section 3641, no product that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages may be offered by the Postal Service unless it has been assigned to the market-dominant or competitive category of mail (as appropriate) either—(1) under this subchapter; or

(2) by or under any other provision of law.

(b) International Mail.—(1) In general.—(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Postal Service may contract for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation only with certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers.

(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or proposals from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air transportation between points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or proposals that meet Postal Service requirements at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal Service may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the Postal Service’s requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers, the Postal Service may contract with foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the Postal Service seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service from any certificated air carrier providing service between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are being sought from foreign air carriers.

(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal Service shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices for the Postal Service designated region or regions developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest.

(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under subparagraph (C) shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices derived from—(i) a weighted average based on market rate data furnished by the International Air Transport Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or

(ii) if such data are not available from those sources, such other neutral, regularly updated set of weighted average market rates as the Postal Service, with the concurrence of certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest, may designate.


(E) If, for purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), concurrence cannot be attained, then the most recently available market rate data described in this subparagraph shall continue to apply for the relevant market or markets.


(2) Contract process.—The Postal Service shall contract for foreign air transportation as set forth in paragraph (1) through an open procurement process that will provide—(A) potential offerors with timely notice of business opportunities in sufficient detail to allow them to make a proposal;

(B) requirements, proposed terms and conditions, and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and

(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to receive prompt feedback upon request.


(3) Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift space.—The Postal Service may enter into contracts to transport mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) if—(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist that make it impractical for the Postal Service to comply with such requirements; or

(B) its demand for lift exceeds the space available to it under existing contracts and—(i) there is insufficient time available to seek additional lift using procedures that comply with those requirements without compromising the Postal Service’s service commitments to its own customers; and

(ii) the Postal Service first offers any certificated air carrier holding a contract to carry mail between the relevant points the opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the terms of its existing contract.




(c) Good Faith Effort Required.—The Postal Service and potential offerors shall put a good-faith effort into resolving disputes concerning the award of contracts made under subsection (b).

(d) If the Postal Service determines that service by certificated air carriers or combination of air carriers between any pair or pairs of points in foreign air transportation is not adequate for its purposes, it may contract, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, with any air taxi operator or combination thereof for such air transportation service. Contracts made under this subsection may be renewed at the existing rate by mutual agreement between the holder and the Postal Service. The Postal Service, with the consent of the air taxi operator, may adjust the compensation under such contracts for increased or decreased costs occasioned by changed conditions occurring during the contract term. The Postal Service shall cancel such a contract when the Secretary authorizes an additional certificated carrier or carriers to provide service between any pair or pairs of points covered by the contract, and such carrier or carriers inaugurate schedules adequate for its purposes.

(e)(1) The Postal Service may determine rates and contract with any air carrier for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate air transportation either through negotiations or competitive bidding.

(2)(A) In the exercise of its authority under paragraph (1), the Postal Service may require any air carrier to accept as mail shipments of day-old poultry, honeybees, and such other live animals as postal regulations allow to be transmitted as mail matter. The authority of the Postal Service under this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of any air carrier who commonly and regularly refuses to accept any live animals as cargo.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Postal Service is authorized to assess, as postage to be paid by the mailers of any shipments covered by subparagraph (A), a reasonable surcharge that the Postal Service determines in its discretion to be adequate to compensate air carriers for any necessary additional expense incurred in handling such shipments.



(f) The authority of the Secretary and the Postal Service under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall also apply, and the authority of the Postal Service under subsection (e) shall not apply, to the transportation of mail by aircraft between any two points both of which are within the State of Alaska and between which the air carrier is authorized by the Secretary to engage in the transportation of mail.

(g)(1)(A) The Postal Service, in selecting carriers of nonpriority bypass mail to any point served by more than 1 carrier in the State of Alaska, shall adhere to an equitable tender policy within a qualified group of carriers, in accordance with the regulations of the Postal Service, and shall, at a minimum, require that any such carrier—(i) hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under section 41102(a) of title 49;

(ii) operate at least to such point at least the number of scheduled flights each week established under subparagraph (B)(i);

(iii) exhibit an adherence to such scheduled flights; and

(iv) have provided scheduled service with at least the number of scheduled noncontract flights each week established under subparagraph (B)(ii) between 2 points within the State of Alaska for at least 12 consecutive months with aircraft—(I) up to 7,500 pounds payload capacity before being selected as a carrier of nonpriority bypass mail at an applicable intra-Alaska bush service mail rate; and

(II) over 7,500 pounds payload capacity before being selected as a carrier of nonpriority bypass mail at the intra-Alaska mainline service mail rate.



(B)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)—(I) for aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(I) the number is 3; and

(II) for aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(II), the number is 2, except as may be provided under subparagraph (C).


(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv)—(I) for aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(I), the number is 3; and

(II) for aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(II), for any week in any month before the effective date of the Rural Air Service Improvement Act of 2004, the number is 3, and after such date, the number is 2.



(C) The Postal Service, after consultation with affected carriers, may establish for service by aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(II)—(i) a larger number of flights than required under subparagraph (B)(i); or

(ii) the days that service will operate.



(2) The Postal Service—(A) may provide direct mainline non-priority bypass mail service to any bush point in the State of Alaska, without regard to paragraph (1)(B), if such service is equal to or better than interline service in cost and quality;

(B) shall deduct the non-priority bypass mail poundage flown on direct mainline flights to bush points within the State of Alaska by any carrier, from such carrier’s allocation of the total poundage of non-priority bypass mail transported to the nearest appropriate Postal Service hub point in any month;

(C) shall offer a bush passenger carrier providing service on a route in the State of Alaska between an acceptance point and a hub not served by a mainline carrier the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates when a mainline carrier begins serving that route if the bush passenger carrier—(i) meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(ii) provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as calculated in subsection (h)(5)) between such city pair for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the bush carrier seeks such tender; and

(iii) continues to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair while seeking such tender;


(D) shall offer bush passenger carriers and nonmail freight carriers the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates from a hub point to a destination city in the State of Alaska if the city pair is also being served by a mainline carrier and—(i) for a passenger carrier—(I) the carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(II) the carrier provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as calculated in subsection (h)(5)) on the city pair route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks such tender; and

(III) the carrier continues to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the route; or


(ii) for a nonmail freight carrier—(I) the carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1); and

(II) the carrier provided at least 25 percent of the nonmail freight service (as calculated in subsection (i)(6)) on the city pair route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks such tender;



(E)(i) shall not offer equitable tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail at mainline rates to a bush carrier operating from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska, except as described in subparagraph (C); and

(ii) may tender nonpriority bypass mail at bush rates to a bush carrier from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska if the Postal Service determines that—(I) the bush carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1);

(II) the service to be provided on such route by the bush carrier is not otherwise available through direct mainline service; and

(III) tender of mail to such bush carrier will not decrease the efficiency of nonpriority bypass mail service (in terms of payments to all carriers providing service on the city pair route and timely delivery) for the route;



(F) may offer tender of nonpriority bypass mail to a passenger carrier from an acceptance point to a destination city beyond a hub point in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if the Postal Service determines that—(i) the carrier provides passenger service in accordance with the requirements of subsection (h)(2);

(ii) the carrier qualifies under subsection (h) to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail out of the hub point being bypassed;

(iii) the tender of such mail will not decrease efficiency of delivery of nonpriority bypass mail service into or out of the hub point being bypassed; and

(iv) such tender will result in reduced payments to the carrier by the Postal Service over flying the entire route; and


(G) notwithstanding subparagraph (F), shall offer equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail in proportion to passenger and nonmail freight mail pools described in this section between qualified passenger and nonmail freight carriers on a route from an acceptance point to a bush destination in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if—(i)(I) for a passenger carrier, the carrier receiving the composite rate provided 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair route for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; or

(II) for a nonmail freight carrier, the carrier receiving the composite rate provided at least 25 percent of the nonmail freight service for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; and


(ii)(I) nonpriority bypass mail was being tendered to a passenger carrier or a nonmail freight carrier at a composite rate on such city pair route on January 1, 2000; or

(II) the hub being bypassed was not served by a mainline carrier on January 1, 2000.




The tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subparagraph (G) shall be on an equitable basis between the qualified carriers that provide the direct service on the city pair route and the qualified carriers that provide service between the hub point being bypassed and the destination point, based on the volume of nonpriority bypass mail on both routes.

(3)(A) The Postal Service shall determine the bypass mail bush points and hub points described under paragraph (2)(B) after consultation with the State of Alaska and the affected local communities and air carriers.

(B) Any changes in the determinations of the Postal Service under subparagraph (A) shall be made—(i) after consultation with the State of Alaska and the affected local communities and air carriers; and

(ii) after giving 12 months public notice before any such change takes effect.


(C) When a new hub results from a change in a determination under subparagraph (B), mail tender from that hub during the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of that change shall be based on the passenger and freight shares to the destinations of the affected hub or hubs resulting in the new hub.


(4)(A) Except as provided under subparagraph (B) and paragraph (5), the Postal Service shall select only existing mainline carriers to provide nonpriority bypass mail service between an acceptance point and a hub point in the State of Alaska.

(B) The Postal Service may select a carrier other than an existing mainline carrier to provide nonpriority bypass mail service on a mainline route in the State of Alaska if—(i) the Postal Service determines (in accordance with criteria established in advance by the Postal Service) that the mail service between the acceptance point and the hub point is deficient and provides written notice of the determination to existing mainline carriers to the hub point; and

(ii) after the 30-day period following issuance of notice under clause (i), including notice of inadequate capacity, the Postal Service determines that deficiencies in service to the hub point have not been eliminated.


(C) A providing carrier selected under subparagraph (A) may subcontract the transportation of nonpriority bypass mail to another existing mainline carrier when additional or substitute aircraft are temporarily needed to meet the delivery schedule of the Postal Service or the carrier’s operating requirements. The providing carrier shall remain responsible for the mail from origin through destination.


(5)(A) The Postal Service shall offer equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail to a new 121 mainline passenger carrier entering a mainline route in the State of Alaska, if the carrier—(i) meets the requirements of subsection (g)(1)(A)(iv)(II); and

(ii) has provided at least 75 percent of the number of insured passenger seats as the number of available passenger seats being provided by the mainline passenger carrier providing the greatest number of available passenger seats on that route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail.


(B) A new 121 mainline passenger carrier that is tendered nonpriority mainline bypass mail under subparagraph (A)—(i) shall be eligible for equitable tender of such mail only on city pair routes where the carrier meets the conditions of subparagraph (A);

(ii) may not count the passenger service provided under subparagraph (A) toward the carrier meeting the minimum requirements of this section; and

(iii) shall provide at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as determined for bush passenger carriers in subsection (h)(5)) on such route to remain eligible to be tendered nonpriority mainline bypass mail.


(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and paragraph (1)(B), a new 121 mainline passenger carrier, otherwise qualified under this subsection, may immediately receive equitable tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail to a hub point in the State of Alaska if the carrier meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) and subsection (h)(2)(B) and—(i) all qualified 121 mainline passenger carriers discontinue service on the city pair route; or

(ii) no 121 mainline passenger carrier serves the city pair route.


(D) A carrier operating under a code share agreement on the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 that received tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska may count the passenger service provided under the entire code share arrangement on such route if the code share agreement terminates. That carrier shall continue to provide at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as determined for bush passenger carriers in subsection (h)(5)) between the city pair as a 121 mainline passenger carrier while seeking such tender.


(6)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), passenger carriers providing essential air service under a Department of Transportation order issued under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, shall be tendered all nonpriority mail, in addition to all nonpriority bypass mail, by the Postal Service to destination cities in the State of Alaska served by the essential air service flights consistent with that order unless the Postal Service finds that an essential air service carrier’s service does not meet the needs of the Postal Service.

(B) Service provided under this paragraph, including service provided to points served in conjunction with service being subsidized under the Essential Air Service contract, may not be applied toward any of the minimum eligibility requirements of this section.


(7) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Postal Service from establishing by regulation aircraft preferences for the dispatch of postal products other than nonpriority bypass mail.


(h)(1) Except as provided under paragraph (7), on a city pair route in the State of Alaska, the Postal Service shall offer equitable tender of 70 percent of the nonpriority bypass mail on the route to all carriers providing scheduled bush passenger service in accordance with part 121 or part 135 that—(A) meet the requirements of subsection (g)(1);

(B) provided 20 percent or more of the passenger service (as calculated in paragraph (5)) between the city pair for the 12 months preceding the date on which the 121 passenger aircraft or the 135 passenger carrier seek tender of nonpriority bypass mail; and

(C) meet the requirements of paragraph (2).


(2) To remain eligible for equitable tender under this subsection, the carrier or aircraft shall—(A) continue to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair route for which the carrier is seeking the tender of such nonpriority bypass mail;

(B)(i) for operations under part 121, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 19 passengers;

(ii) for operations under part 135, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 5 passengers; or

(iii) for operations under part 135 where only a water landing is available, operate aircraft type certificated to carry at least 3 passengers;


(C) insure all available passenger seats on the city pair route on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; and

(D) operate flights under its published schedule.


(3)(A) Except as provided under subparagraph (C), a new or existing 121 bush passenger carrier qualified under subsection (g)(1) shall be exempt from the requirements under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) on a city pair route for a period which shall extend for—(i) 1 year;

(ii) 1 year in addition to the extension under clause (i) if, as of the conclusion of the first year, such carrier has been providing not less than 5 percent of the passenger service on that route (as calculated under paragraph (5)); and

(iii) 1 year in addition to the extension under clause (ii) if, as of the conclusion of the second year, such carrier has been providing not less than 10 percent of the passenger service on that route (as calculated under paragraph (5)).


(B)(i) The first 3 121 bush passenger carriers entitled to the exemptions under subparagraph (A) on any city pair route shall divide no more than an additional 10 percent of the mail, apportioned equally, comprised of no more than—(I) 5 percent of the share of each qualified passenger carrier servicing that route that is not a 121 bush passenger carrier; and

(II) 5 percent of the share of each nonpassenger carrier servicing that route that transports 25 percent or more of the total nonmail freight under subsection (i)(1).


(ii) Additional 121 bush passenger carriers entering service on that city pair route after the first 3 shall not receive any additional mail share.

(iii) If any 121 bush passenger carrier on a city pair route receiving an additional share of the mail under clause (ii) discontinues service on that route, the 121 bush passenger carrier that has been providing the longest period of service on that route and is otherwise eligible but is not receiving a share by reason of clause (ii), shall receive the share of the carrier discontinuing service.


(C) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, if only 1 passenger carrier or aircraft is qualified to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail as a passenger carrier or aircraft on a city pair route in the State of Alaska, the Postal Service shall tender 20 percent of the nonpriority bypass mail described under paragraph (1) to the passenger carrier or aircraft providing at least 10 percent of the passenger service on such route.


(4) Qualification for the tender of mail under this subsection shall not be counted toward the minimum qualifications necessary to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail on any other route.

(5)(A) In this section, the percent of passenger service shall be a percentage calculated using data collected under subsection (k).

(B) For the purposes of calculating passenger service as described under subparagraph (A), a bush passenger carrier providing intervillage bush passenger service may include the carriage of passengers carried along any point of the route between the route’s origination point and the final destination point. Such calculation shall be based only on the carriage of passengers on regularly scheduled flights and only on flights being flown in a direction away from the hub point. Passenger service provided on chartered flights shall not be included in the carrier’s calculation of passenger service.


(6)(A) The Secretary shall establish new bush rates for passenger carriers operating in the State of Alaska receiving tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this subsection.

(B) The Secretary shall establish a bush rate based on data collected under subsection (k) from 121 bush passenger carriers. Such rates shall be paid to all bush passenger carriers operating on city pair routes in the State of Alaska where a 121 bush passenger carrier is tendered nonpriority bypass mail.

(C) The Secretary shall establish a bush rate based on data collected under subsection (k) from 135 bush passenger carriers. Such rates shall be paid to all bush passenger carriers operating on bush city pair routes in the State of Alaska where no 121 bush passenger carrier is tendered nonpriority bypass mail.

(D) The Secretary shall establish a bush rate based on data collected under subsection (k) from bush passenger carriers operating aircraft on city pair routes where only water landings are available. Such rates shall be paid to all bush passenger carriers operating on the city pair routes in the State of Alaska where only water landings are available.


(7) The percentage rate in paragraph (1) shall be 75 percent beginning 3 years and 3 months after the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002.


(i)(1) Except as provided under paragraph (7), on a city pair route in the State of Alaska, the Postal Service shall offer equitable tender of 20 percent of the nonpriority bypass mail on such route to those carriers transporting 25 percent or more of the total nonmail freight (in revenue or weight as determined by the Postal Service), for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the freight carrier seeks tender of such mail.

(2) To remain eligible for equitable tender under this subsection, a freight carrier shall continue to provide not less than 25 percent of the nonmail freight service on the city pair route for which the carrier is seeking tender of such mail.

(3) If a new freight carrier enters a market, the freight carrier shall meet the minimum requirements of subsection (g)(1) and shall operate for 12 months on a city pair route in the State of Alaska before being eligible for equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on that route.

(4) If no carrier qualifies for tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska under this subsection, such mail to be divided under this subsection, as described in paragraph (1), shall be tendered to the nonmail freight carrier providing the highest percentage of nonmail freight service (in terms of revenue or weight as determined by the Postal Service as calculated under paragraph (6)) on the city pair route. If no nonmail freight carrier is present on a city pair route in the State of Alaska to receive tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this paragraph, the nonpriority bypass mail to be divided under paragraph (1) shall be divided equitably among carriers qualified under subsection (h).

(5) Qualification for the tender of mail under this subsection shall not be counted toward the minimum qualifications necessary to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail on any other route.

(6) In this subsection, the percent of nonmail freight shall be calculated as a percentage, using the data provided pursuant to subsection (k), by dividing the revenue or weight (as determined by the Postal Service) of nonmail freight earned by or carried by a carrier from the transport of nonmail freight from an origination point to a destination point by the total amount of revenue or weight of nonmail freight earned by or carried by all carriers from the transport of nonmail freight from the origination point to the destination point.

(7) The percentage rate in paragraph (1) shall be 25 percent beginning 3 years and 3 months after the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002.


(j)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (3), there shall be equitable tender of 10 percent of the nonpriority bypass mail to all carriers on each city pair route in the State of Alaska meeting the requirements of subsection (g)(1) that do not otherwise qualify for tender under subsection (h) or (i).

(2) If no carrier qualifies under this subsection with respect to a city pair route, the 10 percent of nonpriority bypass mail allocated under paragraph (1) shall be divided evenly between the pools described under subsections (h) and (i) to be equitably tendered among qualified carriers under such subsections, such that—(A) the amount of nonpriority bypass mail available for tender among qualified carriers under subsection (h) shall be 75 percent; and

(B) the amount of nonpriority bypass mail available for tender among qualified carriers under subsection (i) shall be 25 percent.


(3)(A) Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the percentage rate under paragraph (1) shall be 0 percent beginning 3 years and 3 months after the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002.

(B) The percentage rate under paragraph (1) shall remain 10 percent for equitable tender for 6 years and 3 months after the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 for a nonpriority bypass mail carrier on routes served exclusively by bush carriers in the State of Alaska originating from the main hub of the carrier designated under subparagraph (C), if the carrier seeking the tender of such mail—(i) meets the requirements of subsection (g)(1);

(ii) is not qualified under subsection (h) or (i);

(iii) operates routes originating from the main hub of the carrier designated under subparagraph (C); and

(iv) has invested at least $500,000 in a physical hanger facility prior to January 1, 2002 in such a hub city.


(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), a carrier may designate only one hub city as its main hub and once such designation is transmitted to the Postal Service it may not be changed. Such selection and transmission must be transmitted to the Postal Service within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002. A carrier attempting to receive tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this subsection shall not be eligible for such tender after the carrier becomes qualified for tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subsection (h) or (i) on any route. The purchase of another carrier’s hanger facility after such date of enactment shall not be considered sufficient to meet the requirement of subparagraph (B)(iv).



(k)(1) At least once every 2 years, in conjunction with annual updates, the Secretary shall review the need for a bush mail rate investigation. The Secretary shall use show cause procedures to speedily and more accurately determine the cost of providing bush mail service. In determining such rates, the Secretary shall not take into account the cost of passenger insurance rates or premiums paid by the passenger carriers or other costs associated with passenger service.

(2) In order to ensure sufficient, reliable, and timely traffic data to meet the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall require—(A) the monthly submission of the bush carrier’s data on T–100 diskettes, or any other suitable form of data collection, as determined by the Secretary; and

(B) the carriers to retain all books, records, and other source and summary documentation to support their reports and to preserve and maintain such documentation in a manner that readily permits the audit and examination by representatives of the Postal Service or the Secretary.


(3) Documentation under paragraph (2) shall be retained for 7 years or until the Secretary indicates that the records may be destroyed. Copies of flight logs for aircraft sold or disposed of shall be retained.

(4) Carriers qualified to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail shall submit to the Secretary the number and type of aircraft in the carrier’s fleet, the level of passenger insurance covering its fleet, and the name of the insurance company providing such coverage.


(l) No qualified carrier may be tendered nonpriority bypass mail under subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously on a route unless no other carrier is tendered mail under either subsection.

(m)(1) Carriers qualifying for tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously shall be tendered such mail under subsection (h).

(2) A carrier shall be tendered nonpriority bypass mail under subsection (i) if that carrier—(A) was qualified under both subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously; and

(B) becomes unqualified under subsection (h) but remains qualified under subsection (i).



(n)(1) A carrier operation resulting from a merger or acquisition between any 2 carriers operating between points in the State of Alaska shall have the passenger and nonmail freight of all such merged or acquired carriers on the applicable route counted toward meeting the resulting carrier’s minimum requirements to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on such route for the 12-month period following the date of the merger or acquisition.

(2) After the 12-month period described under paragraph (1), the carrier resulting from the merger or acquisition shall demonstrate that the carrier meets the minimum passenger or nonmail freight carriage requirements of this section to continue receiving tender of such mail.


(o) In addition to any penalties applied to a carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Secretary, any carrier that significantly misstates passenger or nonmail freight data required to be reported under this section on any route, in an attempt to qualify for tender of nonpriority bypass mail, shall receive—(1) a 1-month suspension of tender of nonpriority bypass mail on the route where the data was misstated for the first offense;

(2) a 6-month suspension of tender of nonpriority bypass mail on the route where the data was misstated for the second offense;

(3) a 1-year suspension of tender of all nonpriority bypass mail in the entire State of Alaska for the third offense in the State; and

(4) a permanent suspension of tender of all nonpriority bypass mail in the entire State of Alaska for the fourth offense in the State.


(p)(1) The Postal Service or the Secretary, in carrying out subsection (g)(2), (h), or (i), may deny equitable tender to an otherwise qualified carrier that does not operate under this section in good faith or under the intent of this section.

(2) The Postal Service or the Secretary may waive any provision of subsection (h) or (i), if the carrier provides substantial passenger or nonmail freight service on the route in the State of Alaska where the carrier seeks tender of nonpriority mail and nonpriority bypass mail.

(3) To ensure adequate competition among passenger carriers on a mainline route in the State of Alaska the Postal Service or the Secretary may waive the requirements of subsection (g)(1)(A)(iv), (g)(2)(E), (g)(4), or (g)(5), or any provision of subsection (h) if a 121 bush passenger carrier seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a mainline route in the State of Alaska not served by a 121 mainline passenger carrier and the 121 bush passenger carrier provides substantial passenger service on the route. Waivers provided for under this paragraph shall be granted only in extreme cases of lack of competition and only to extent that are absolutely necessary to meet the minimum needs of the community. Waivers granted under this subsection shall cease to be valid once a qualified mainline passenger carrier begins providing service and seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail in accordance with this section on the city pair route. The receipt of waivers and subsequent operation of service on a city pair route under this subsection shall not be counted towards meeting the requirements of any part of this section for any other city pair route.

(4) In granting waivers for or denying tender to carriers under this subsection, the Postal Service or the Secretary shall consider in the following order of importance—(A) the passenger needs of the destination to be served (including amount and level);

(B) the nonmail freight needs of the destination to be served;

(C) the amount of nonpriority bypass mail service already available to the destination;

(D) the mail needs of the destination to be served;

(E) the savings to the Postal Service in terms of payments made to carriers;

(F) the amount or level of passenger service already available to the destination; and

(G) the amount of nonmail freight service already available to the destination.



(q) The Secretary shall make a regular review of carriers receiving, or attempting to qualify to receive, equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska. If the Secretary suspends or revokes an operating certificate, the Secretary shall notify the Postal Service.

FindingsPub. L. 107–206, title III, § 3002(b), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 910, provided that: 
“Congress makes the following findings:
“(1) The State of Alaska is the largest State in the Union and has a very limited system of roads connecting communities.

“(2) Alaska has more pilots per capita than any other State in the Union.

“(3) Pilots flying in Alaska are often the most skilled and best-prepared pilots in the world.

“(4) Air travel within the State of Alaska is often hampered by severe weather conditions and treacherous terrain.

“(5) The United States Government owns nearly ⅔ of Alaska’s landmass, including large tracts of land separating isolated communities within the State.

“(6) Such Federal ownership has inhibited the ability of Alaskans to build roads connecting isolated communities.

“(7) Most communities and a large portion of the population within the State can only be reached by air.

“(8) The vast majority of food items and everyday necessities destined for these isolated communities and populations can only be transported through the air.

“(9) The Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system, created by Congress and operated by the United States Postal Service under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code, with input from the Department of Transportation, connecting hundreds of rural and isolated communities within the State, is a critical piece of the Alaska and the national transportation system. The system is like a 4-legged stool, designed to—“(A) provide the most affordable means of delivering food and everyday necessities to these rural and isolated communities;

“(B) establish a system whereby the Postal Service can meet its obligations to deliver mail to every house and business in the United States;

“(C) support affordable and reliable passenger service; and

“(D) support affordable and reliable nonmail freight service.


“(10) Without the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system—“(A) it would be difficult and more expensive for the Postal Service to meet its obligation of delivering mail to every house and business in the United States; and

“(B) food, medicine, freight, and everyday necessities and passenger service for these rural and isolated communities would cost several times the current level.


“(11) Attempts by Congress to support passenger and nonmail freight service in Alaska using the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system have yielded some positive results, but some carriers have been manipulating the system by carrying few, if any, passengers and little nonmail freight while earning most of their revenues from the carriage of nonpriority bypass mail.

“(12) As long as the Federal Government continues to own large tracts of land within the State of Alaska which impede access to isolated communities, it is in the best interest of the Postal Service, the residents of Alaska and the United States—“(A) to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system remains strong, viable, and affordable for the Postal Service;

“(B) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe passenger service;

“(C) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe nonmail freight service;

“(D) to encourage that intra-Alaska air carriers move toward safer, more secure, and more reliable air transportation under the Federal Aviation Administration’s guidelines and in accordance with part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, where such operations are supported by the needs of the community; and

“(E) that Congress, pursuant to the authority granted under Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution to establish Post Offices and post roads, make changes to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system continues to be used to support substantial passenger and nonmail freight service and to reduce costs for the Postal Service.”





Actions of Air Carriers To Qualify as Bush Passengers or Nonmail Freight CarriersPub. L. 107–206, title III, § 3002(d), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 923, provided that: “Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 2, 2002], if the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary’s findings and recommendations of the Postal Service, that an air carrier being tendered nonpriority bush bypass mail is not taking actions to attempt to qualify as a bush passenger or nonmail freight carrier under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code (as amended by this title), the Postal Service shall immediately cease tender of all nonpriority bypass mail to such carrier.”


Reports to CongressPub. L. 107–206, title III, § 3002(f), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 924, provided that, not later than 18 months after Aug. 2, 2002, the Postal Service and the Secretary of Transportation were to submit a report to the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate on the progress of implementing title III of Pub. L. 107–206.
