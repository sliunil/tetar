“(a) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Tables for classification] is to improve the United States Code by making necessary technical changes.

“(b) No Substantive Change.—This Act makes no substantive change in existing law and may not be construed as making a substantive change in existing law.

“(c) Severability.—If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications.”



Pub. L. 107–217, § 5, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1303, provided that:
“(a) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to revise, codify, and enact without substantive change the general and permanent laws of the United States related to public buildings, property, and works, in order to remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections and to repeal obsolete, superfluous, and superseded provisions.

“(b) No Substantive Change.—“(1) In general.—This Act makes no substantive change in existing law and may not be construed as making a substantive change in existing law.

“(2) Deemed date of enactment for certain purposes.—For purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes another based on enactment later in time, and otherwise to ensure that this Act makes no substantive change in existing law, the date of enactment of a provision restated in section 1 or 2 of this Act is deemed to remain unchanged, continuing to be the date of enactment of the underlying provision of public law that is being restated.

“(3) Inconsistent laws enacted after March 31, 2002.—This Act restates certain laws enacted before April 1, 2002. Any law enacted after March 31, 2002, that is inconsistent with this Act, including any law purporting to amend or repeal a provision that is repealed by this Act, supersedes this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.


“(c) References.—A reference to a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act, including a reference in a regulation, order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.

“(d) Continuing Effect.—An order, rule, or regulation in effect under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act continues in effect under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act until repealed, amended, or superseded.

“(e) Actions and Offenses Under Prior Law.—An action taken or an offense committed under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act is deemed to have been taken or committed under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.

“(f) Inferences.—An inference of a legislative construction is not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a caption or catch line of the provision.

“(g) Severability.—If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications.”




RepealsPub. L. 108–178, § 2(b), Dec. 15, 2003, 117 Stat. 2640, provided that: 
“Section 6(b) of Public Law 107–217 (116 Stat. 1304) [see below] is repealed insofar as it relates to the provisions listed below, and the provisions listed below are revived to read as if section 6(b) had not been enacted:

This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words “this Act”, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words “this Act” are restated, substituting the words “this subtitle” does not yield an accurate literal translation because “this subtitle” does not include title III of the Act. This section does not subject any provision of law to title III of the Act if that provision was not subject to title III prior to the positive law codification of title 40.

Editorial Notes
Amendments2011—Pub. L. 111–350 substituted “division C (except sections 3302, 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41” for “Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949” in section catchline and for “title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)” in introductory provisions.

(b) Description.—A policy, procedure, or directive referred to in subsection (a) is one that was in effect on July 1, 1949, and that was prescribed by—(1) the Director of the Bureau of Federal Supply or the Secretary of the Treasury and that related to a function transferred to or vested in the Administrator of General Services on June 30, 1949, by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; 11 See References in Text note below.

Executive Order No. 12512
Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, which related to Federal real property management, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13327, § 8, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, set out below.


Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts
Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:
Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government’s economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.
An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.
NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.
Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (“Secretary”) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.
(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.
(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.
Sec. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.
(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.
Sec. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.
(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.
Sec. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking employees and have been the subject of debarment.
Sec. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.
Sec. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary’s functions under this order.
Sec. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.
Sec. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
Sec. 11. The meaning of the term “organizational unit of a Federal contractor” as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.
Sec. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.
(b) This order is effective immediately.

William J. Clinton.

Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate—Increasing Sales Proceeds, Cutting Operating Costs, and Improving Energy Efficiency
Memorandum of President of the United States, June 10, 2010, 75 F.R. 33987, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to eliminating all forms of Government waste and to leading by example as our Nation transitions to a clean energy economy. For decades, the Federal Government, the largest property owner and energy user in the United States, has managed more real estate than necessary to effectively support its programs and missions. Both taxpayer dollars and energy resources are being wasted to maintain these excess assets. In addition, many of the properties necessary for the Government’s work are not operated efficiently, resulting in wasted funds and excessive greenhouse gas pollution. For example, over the past decade, the private sector reduced its data center footprint by capitalizing on innovative technologies to increase efficiencies. However, during that same period, the Federal Government experienced a substantial increase in the number of data centers, leading to increased energy consumption, real property expenditures, and operations and maintenance costs. Past attempts at reducing the Federal Government’s civilian real property assets produced small savings and had a minor impact on the condition and performance of mission-critical properties. These efforts were not sufficiently comprehensive in disposing of excess real estate and did not emphasize making more efficient use of existing assets.
To eliminate wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars, save energy and water, and further reduce greenhouse gas pollution, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to accelerate efforts to identify and eliminate excess properties. Agencies shall also take immediate steps to make better use of remaining real property assets as measured by utilization and occupancy rates, annual operating cost, energy efficiency, and sustainability. To the extent permitted by law, agency actions shall include accelerating cycle times for identifying excess assets and disposing of surplus assets; eliminating lease arrangements that are not cost effective; pursuing consolidation opportunities within and across agencies in common asset types (such as data centers, office space, warehouses, and laboratories); increasing occupancy rates in current facilities through innovative approaches to space management and alternative workplace arrangements, such as telework; and identifying offsetting reductions in inventory when new space is acquired. Agency actions taken under this memorandum shall align with and support the actions to measure and reduce resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in Federal facilities pursuant to [former] Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance), and the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, which was announced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in February 2010.
In total, agency efforts required by this memorandum should produce no less than $3 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2012, yielded from increased proceeds from the sale of assets and reduced operating, maintenance, and energy expenses from disposals or other space consolidation efforts, including leases that are ended. This is in addition to the Department of Defense’s Base Realignment and Closure efforts that are expected to achieve $9.8 billion in savings from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2012, of which $5 billion is a direct result of reduced operating and maintenance from disposals or other consolidation efforts. In addition, in order to address the growth of data centers across the Federal Government, agencies shall immediately adopt a policy against expanding data centers beyond current levels, and shall develop plans to consolidate and significantly reduce data centers within 5 years. Agencies shall submit their plans to OMB for review by August 30, 2010.
To achieve these goals, the Director of the OMB shall develop, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Federal Real Property Council established pursuant to Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management), within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, guidance for actions agencies should take to carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The guidance shall include agency-specific targets to achieve $3 billion in cost savings and shall be developed in consultation with the agencies. The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Director of the OMB, shall coordinate agency efforts to satisfy the requirements of this memorandum and shall submit to the President periodic reports on the results achieved.
This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Barack Obama.

In subsection (a)(2), the words “or any Federal agency” and “or any Federal agency, as the case may be” are omitted as unnecessary.
In subsection (a)(3), the words “fraudulently obtained” are substituted for “thus secured and obtained” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (d)(1), the word “several” is omitted as unnecessary. The words “the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia” in section 209(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 are omitted as included in “a district court of the United States” because of sections 88 and 132(a) of title 28.
Subsection (d)(2) is substituted for “[D]istrict courts . . . within whose jurisdictional limits the person, or persons, doing or committing such act, or any one of them, resides or shall be found, shall wheresoever such act may have been done or committed, have full power and jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine such suit” for clarity and to use terminology consistent with title 28, especially 28:1331 and 1391(b).
In subsection (d)(3), the words “A defendant that does not reside and may not be found in the court’s judicial district” are substituted for “and such person or persons as are not inhabitants of or found within the district in which suit is brought” for clarity and to use terminology consistent with title 28, especially 28:1331 and 1391(b).



§ 124. Agency use of amounts for property management

BUILDING AND SPACE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
Section 1.

Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.
The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services—the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.
Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.
Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.
The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.
This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.
Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.
In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.
While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.
The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.
After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.
While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.

Harry S Truman.

In subsections (a) and (b), the words “and title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)” are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words “this Act”, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under section 111 of this title. Reference to title V of this Act is omitted as obsolete because of the Act of October 22, 1968 (Public Law 90–620, 82 Stat. 1238), the first section of which enacted Title 44, United States Code. The responsibilities of the Administrator of General Services under title V were given to the Archivist of the United States, National Historical Publications and Records Commission, and Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress.
In subsection (a), the words “subject to chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” are substituted for “subject to the civil-service and classification laws” because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89–554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.
In subsection (b), the words “under section 3109 of title 5” are substituted for “(not in excess of one year)” and “or organizations thereof, including stenographic reporting services, by contract or appointment, and in such cases such service shall be without regard to the civil-service and classification laws, and except in the case of stenographic reporting services by organizations, without regard to section 5 of title 41” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (c), the words “section 973 of title 10” are substituted for “section 1222 of the Revised Statutes (10 U. S. C. 576)” in section 208(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 49(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640), the first section of which enacted Title 10, United States Code, and section 4(a)(5) and (6) of the Act of January 2, 1968 (Public Law 90–235, 81 Stat. 759). The words “personnel (including armed services personnel) from an executive agency other than the General Services Administration” are substituted for “officials, officers, and other personnel in other executive agencies, including personnel of the armed services” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
In subsection (d), the words “On and after June 23, 1913” are omitted as obsolete. The word “Administrator” is substituted for “Secretary of the Treasury” [subsequently changed to “Federal Works Administrator” because of section 301 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426)], and the word “Administration” [meaning the General Services Administration] is substituted for “public-buildings service” and “Office of the Supervising Architect” [subsequently changed to “Public Buildings Administration” because of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1427)], because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title. The words “such as supervising superintendents, superintendents, junior superintendents, and inspectors of the several classes” are omitted as unnecessary.

The words “Director of the Office of Management and Budget” are substituted for “Director of the Bureau of the Budget” in section 206(a)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
In subsection (a)(1)(D), the words “Subject to regulations” are substituted for “subject to regulations and regulations” in section 206(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to correct an error resulting from an inconsistency between section 8(d)(1) and section 9(a)(2) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98–191, 97 Stat. 1331).
In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words “Department of Defense” are substituted for “National Military Establishment” in section 206(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the Department of Defense is deemed to succeed the National Military Establishment under section 12(a) and (g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (ch. 412, 63 Stat. 591).
In subsection (c), the words “Comptroller General” are substituted for “General Accounting Office” because of 31:702 and for consistency in the revised title.

§ 545. Procedure for disposal(a) Public Advertising for Bids.—(1) Requirement.—(A) In general.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Administrator of General Services may make or authorize a disposal or a contract for disposal of surplus property only after public advertising for bids, under regulations the Administrator prescribes.

(B) Exceptions.—This subsection does not apply to disposal or a contract for disposal of surplus property—(i) under subsection (b) or (d); or

(2) Time, method, and terms.—The time, method, and terms and conditions of advertisement must permit full and free competition consistent with the value and nature of the property involved.

(3) Public disclosure.—Bids must be publicly disclosed at the time and place stated in the advertisement.

(4) Awards.—An award shall be made with reasonable promptness by notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is most advantageous to the Federal Government, price and other factors considered. However, all bids may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so.


(b) Negotiated Disposal.—Under regulations the Administrator prescribes, disposals and contracts for disposal may be negotiated without regard to subsection (a), but subject to obtaining competition that is feasible under the circumstances, if—(1) necessary in the public interest—(A) during the period of a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, with respect to a particular lot of personal property; or

(B) for a period not exceeding three months, with respect to a specifically described category of personal property as determined by the Administrator;

(8) the disposal will be to a State, territory, or possession of the United States, or to a political subdivision of, or a tax-supported agency in, a State, territory, or possession, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation; or

(9) otherwise authorized by law.


(c) Disposal Through Contract Brokers.—Disposals and contracts for disposal of surplus real and related personal property through contract realty brokers employed by the Administrator shall be made in the manner followed in similar commercial transactions under regulations the Administrator prescribes. The regulations must require that brokers give wide public notice of the availability of the property for disposal.

(d) Negotiated Sale at Fixed Price.—(1) Authorization.—The Administrator may make a negotiated sale of personal property at a fixed price, either directly or through the use of a disposal contractor, without regard to subsection (a). However, the sale must be publicized to an extent consistent with the value and nature of the property involved and the price established must reflect the estimated fair market value of the property. Sales under this subsection are limited to categories of personal property for which the Administrator determines that disposal under this subsection best serves the interests of the Government.

(2) First offer.—Under regulations and restrictions the Administrator prescribes, an opportunity to purchase property at a fixed price under this subsection may be offered first to an entity specified in subsection (b)(8) that has expressed an interest in the property.


(e) Explanatory Statements for Negotiated Disposals.—(1) Requirement.—(A) In general.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an explanatory statement of the circumstances shall be prepared for each disposal by negotiation of—(i) personal property that has an estimated fair market value in excess of $15,000;

(v) real property or real and related personal property disposed of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property for which any part of the consideration is real property.


(B) Exception.—An explanatory statement is not required for a disposal of personal property under subsection (d), or for a disposal of real or personal property authorized by any other law to be made without advertising.


(2) Transmittal to congress.—The explanatory statement shall be transmitted to the appropriate committees of Congress in advance of the disposal, and a copy of the statement shall be preserved in the files of the executive agency making the disposal.

(3) Listing in report.—A report of the Administrator under section 126 of this title must include a listing and description of any negotiated disposals of surplus property having an estimated fair market value of more than $15,000, in the case of real property, or $5,000, in the case of any other property, other than disposals for which an explanatory statement has been transmitted under this subsection.


(f) Applicability of Other Law.—Section 6101(b)–(d) of title 41 does not apply to a disposal or contract for disposal made under this section.

Executive Documents

Ex. Ord. No. 12999. Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century
Ex. Ord. No. 12999, Apr. 17, 1996, 61 F.R. 17227, provided:
In order to ensure that American children have the skills they need to succeed in the information-intensive 21st century, the Federal Government is committed to working with the private sector to promote four major developments in American education: making modern computer technology an integral part of every classroom; providing teachers with the professional development they need to use new technologies effectively; connecting classrooms to the National Information Infrastructure; and encouraging the creation of excellent educational software. This Executive order streamlines the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to our Nation’s classrooms and encourages Federal employees to volunteer their time and expertise to assist teachers and to connect classrooms.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377 [now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of Title 41, Public Contracts], and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104–106 [see Tables for classification], it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Protection of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment. (a) Educationally useful Federal equipment is a vital national resource. To the extent such equipment can be used as is, separated into parts for other computers, or upgraded—either by professional technicians, students, or other recycling efforts—educationally useful Federal equipment is a valuable tool for computer education. Therefore, to the extent possible, all executive departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to as “agencies”) shall protect and safeguard such equipment, particularly when declared excess or surplus, so that it may be recycled and transferred, if appropriate, pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. Efficient Transfer of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment to Schools and Nonprofit Organizations. (a) To the extent permitted by law, all agencies shall give highest preference to schools and nonprofit organizations, including community-based educational organizations, (“schools and nonprofit organizations”) in the transfer, through gift or donation, of educationally useful Federal equipment.
(b) Agencies shall attempt to give particular preference to schools and nonprofit organizations located in the Federal enterprise communities and empowerment zones established in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103–66 [see 26 U.S.C. 1391 et seq.].
(c) Each agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and where appropriate, identify educationally useful Federal equipment that it no longer needs and transfer it to a school or nonprofit organization by:
(1) conveying research equipment directly to the school or organization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 3710(i); or
(2) reporting excess equipment to the General Services Administration (GSA) for donation when declared surplus in accordance with section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 484(j) [now 40 U.S.C. 549]. Agencies shall report such equipment as far as possible in advance of the date the equipment becomes excess, so that GSA may attempt to arrange direct transfers from the donating agency to recipients eligible under this order.
(d) In transfers made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, title shall transfer directly from the agency to the schools or nonprofit organizations as required by 15 U.S.C. 3710(i). All such transfers shall be reported to the GSA. At the direction of the recipient institution or organization, and if appropriate, transferred equipment may be conveyed initially to a nonprofit reuse or recycling program that will upgrade it before transfer to the school or nonprofit organization holding title.
(e) All transfers to schools or nonprofit organizations, whether made directly or through GSA, shall be made at the lowest cost to the school or nonprofit organization permitted by law.
(f) The availability of educationally useful Federal equipment shall be made known to eligible recipients under this order by all practicable means, including newspaper, community announcements, and the Internet.
(g) The regional Federal Executive Boards shall help facilitate the transfer of educationally useful Federal equipment from the agencies they represent to recipients eligible under this order.
Sec. 3. Assisting Teachers’ Professional Development: Connecting Classrooms. (a) Each agency that has employees who have computer expertise shall, to the extent permitted by law and in accordance with the guidelines of the Office of Personnel Management, encourage those employees to:
(1) help connect America’s classrooms to the National Information Infrastructure;
(2) assist teachers in learning to use computers to teach; and
(3) provide ongoing maintenance of and technical support for the educationally useful Federal equipment transferred pursuant to this order.
(b) Each agency described in subsection (a) shall submit to the Office of Science and Technology Policy, within 6 months of the date of this order, an implementation plan to advance the developments described in this order, particularly those required in this section. The plan shall be consistent with approved agency budget totals and shall be coordinated through the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
(c) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to bar a recipient of educationally useful Federal equipment from lending that equipment, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, to a teacher, administrator, student, employee, or other designated person in furtherance of educational goals.
Sec. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) “Schools” means individual public or private education institutions encompassing prekindergarten through twelfth grade, as well as public school districts.
(b) “Community-based educational organizations” means nonprofit entities that are engaged in collaborative projects with schools or that have education as their primary focus. Such organizations shall qualify as nonprofit educational institutions or organizations for purposes of section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [now 40 U.S.C. 549].
(c) “Educationally useful Federal equipment” means computers and related peripheral tools (e.g., printers, modems, routers, and servers), including telecommunications and research equipment, that are appropriate for use in prekindergarten, elementary, middle, or secondary school education. It shall also include computer software, where the transfer of licenses is permitted.
(d) “Nonprofit reuse or recycling program” means a 501(c) organization able to upgrade computer equipment at no or low cost to the school or nonprofit organization taking title to it.
(e) “Federal Executive Boards,” as defined in 5 C.F.R. Part 960, are regional organizations of each Federal agency’s highest local officials.
Sec. 5. This order shall supersede Executive Order No. 12821 of November 16, 1992.
Sec. 6. Judicial Review. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees.

William J. Clinton.

FindingsPub. L. 117–328, div. Z, § 102, Dec. 29, 2022, 136 Stat. 5523, provided that: 
“Congress finds the following:
“(1) Access to computers and computer technology is indispensable for success in the 21st century. Millions of Americans do not regularly use a computer and research shows that substantial disparities remain in both internet use and the quality of access, with the digital divide concentrated among older, less educated, less affluent populations, especially veterans, low-income students, and senior citizens.

“(2) The COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted the gap between those with computer access and those without. Millions of students, their families, and workers from across the economy were unable to do schoolwork, work remotely from home, or connect to loved ones and their communities because of the digital divide.

“(3) Any Federal program that distributes surplus, repairable Federal computers or technology equipment would benefit from a partnership with a nonprofit organization whose mission is bridging the digital divide.”

Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas
Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation’s wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.
Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.
The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:
1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.
(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.
(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.
(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.
2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.
3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.
This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.
All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.
This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

William J. Clinton.

(b) Transfer of Functions by Director of the Office of Management and Budget.—(1) In general.—When the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines that it is in the interest of economy or efficiency, the Director shall transfer to the Administrator all functions vested in a federal agency with respect to the operation, maintenance, and custody of an office building owned by the Government or a wholly owned Government corporation, or an office building, or part of an office building, that is occupied by a federal agency under a lease.

(2) Exception for post-office buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a post-office building, unless the Director determines that the building is not used predominantly for post-office purposes. The Administrator may delegate functions with respect to a post-office building that are transferred to the Administrator under this subsection only to another officer or employee of the General Services Administration or to the Postmaster General.

(3) Exception for buildings in a foreign country.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located in a foreign country.

(4) Exception for department of defense buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located on the grounds of a facility of the Department of Defense (including a fort, camp, post, arsenal, navy yard, naval training station, airfield, proving ground, military supply depot, or school) unless and only to the extent that the Secretary of Defense has issued a permit for use by another agency.

(5) Exception for groups of special purpose buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building that the Director finds to be a part of a group of buildings that are—(A) located in the same vicinity;

(B) used wholly or predominantly for the special purposes of the agency with custody of the buildings; and

(C) not generally suitable for use by another agency.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 486 of Title 40 of the United States Code [now 40 U.S.C. 121], in order to institute fundamental changes in the manner in which Federal work space is managed to ensure its efficient utilization, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. In order to make the Federal use of work space (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space, whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all Federal Executive agencies shall:
(a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency missions;
(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;
(c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be performed;
(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;
(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;
(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;
(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and
(h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide reporting system may be developed.
Sec. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.

§ 585. Lease agreements(a) In General.—(1) Authority.—The Administrator of General Services may enter into a lease agreement with a person, copartnership, corporation, or other public or private entity for the accommodation of a federal agency in a building (or improvement) which is in existence or being erected by the lessor to accommodate the federal agency. The Administrator may assign and reassign the leased space to a federal agency.

(2) Terms.—A lease agreement under this subsection shall be on terms the Administrator considers to be in the interest of the Federal Government and necessary for the accommodation of the federal agency. However, the lease agreement may not bind the Government for more than 20 years and the obligation of amounts for a lease under this subsection is limited to the current fiscal year for which payments are due without regard to section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31.


(b) Sublease.—(1) Application.—This subsection applies to rent received if the Administrator—(A) determines that an unexpired portion of a lease of space to the Government is surplus property; and

(B) disposes of the property by sublease.


(2) Use of rent.—Notwithstanding section 571(a) of this title, the Administrator may deposit rent received into the Federal Buildings Fund. The Administrator may defray from the fund any costs necessary to provide services to the Government’s lessee and to pay the rent (not otherwise provided for) on the lease of the space to the Government.


(c) Amounts for Rent Available for Lease of Buildings on Government Land.—Amounts made available to the General Services Administration for the payment of rent may be used to lease space, for a period of not more than 30 years, in buildings erected on land owned by the Government.

(d) Any bargain-price option to purchase at less than fair market value contained in any lease agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2021, pursuant to this section may be exercised only to the extent specifically provided for in subsequent appropriation Acts or other Acts of Congress.

In subsection (b)(3), the words “Federal Buildings Fund” are substituted for “the fund” for clarity and to execute the probable intent of Congress. Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92–313, 86 Stat. 218) added subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words “the fund” appear) and amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which “charges made pursuant to subsection (j)” are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)). That fund was subsequently named “Federal Buildings Fund” by section 153(1) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–486, 106 Stat. 2851). If an exemption from charges is granted under 40:490(j), “the fund” that suffers the loss of revenue is the Federal Buildings Fund.
In subsection (d), the words “on and after October 6, 1992” are omitted as obsolete. The words “subsection (b)” are substituted for “section 201(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(j))” in section 5(a) of the Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably “section 210(j)”, which is restated in this section. The text of 40:490f(b) is omitted as executed.

The Administrator may make a telecommuting center available for use by others to the extent it is not fully utilized by federal employees.

(3) User fees.—The Administrator shall charge a user fee for the use of a telecommuting center. The amount of the user fee shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. However, the user fee may not be less than necessary to pay the cost of establishing and operating the telecommuting center, including the reasonable cost of renovation and replacement of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

(4) Deposit and use of fees.—The Administrator may—(A) deposit user fees into the Federal Buildings Fund and use the fees to pay costs incurred in establishing and operating the telecommuting center; and

(B) accept and retain income received by the General Services Administration, from federal agencies and non-federal sources, to defray costs directly associated with the functions of telecommuting centers.

(2) Consideration by executive agencies.—In considering whether to acquire space, quarters, buildings, or other facilities for use by employees, the head of an executive agency shall consider whether needs can be met using alternative workplace arrangements.

(3) Guidance from administrator.—The Administrator may provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to any person regarding the establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements.


(d) Amounts Available for Flexiplace Work Telecommuting Programs.—(1) Definition.—In this subsection, the term “flexiplace work telecommuting program” means a program under which employees of a department or agency set out in paragraph (2) are permitted to perform all or a portion of their duties at a telecommuting center established under this section or other federal law.

(2) Minimum funding.—For each of the following departments and agencies, in each fiscal year at least $50,000 of amounts made available for salaries and expenses is available only for carrying out a flexiplace work telecommuting program:(A) Department of Agriculture.

(b) Application.—This section applies if an agency (or unit of the agency), moves from one controlled space to another, whether in the same or a different location.

(c) Moving Existing Furniture.—The furniture and furnishings used by an agency (or organizational unit of the agency) shall be moved only if the Administrator determines, after consultation with the head of the agency and with due regard for the program activities of the agency, that it would not be more economical and efficient to make suitable replacements available in the new controlled space.

(d) Providing Replacement Furniture.—In the absence of a determination under subsection (c), suitable furniture and furnishings for the new controlled space shall be provided from stocks under the control of the moving agency or from stocks available to the Administrator, whichever the Administrator determines to be more economical and efficient. However, the same or similar items may not be provided from both sources.

(e) Control of Replacement Furniture.—If furniture and furnishings for a new controlled space are provided from stocks available to the Administrator, the items being provided remain in the control of the Administrator.

Payment may be either in advance of, or on or during, occupancy of the space.

§ 3142. Rate of wages for laborers and mechanics(a) Application.—The advertised specifications for every contract in excess of $2,000, to which the Federal Government or the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration, or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings and public works of the Government or the District of Columbia that are located in a State or the District of Columbia and which requires or involves the employment of mechanics or laborers shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics.

(b) Based on Prevailing Wage.—The minimum wages shall be based on the wages the Secretary of Labor determines to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the civil subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed, or in the District of Columbia if the work is to be performed there.

(c) Stipulations Required in Contract.—Every contract based upon the specifications referred to in subsection (a) must contain stipulations that—(1) the contractor or subcontractor shall pay all mechanics and laborers employed directly on the site of the work, unconditionally and at least once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at time of payment, computed at wage rates not less than those stated in the advertised specifications, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and the laborers and mechanics;

(2) the contractor will post the scale of wages to be paid in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work; and

(3) there may be withheld from the contractor so much of accrued payments as the contracting officer considers necessary to pay to laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of wages required by the contract to be paid laborers and mechanics on the work and the rates of wages received by the laborers and mechanics and not refunded to the contractor or subcontractors or their agents.


(d) Discharge of Obligation.—The obligation of a contractor or subcontractor to make payment in accordance with the prevailing wage determinations of the Secretary of Labor, under this subchapter and other laws incorporating this subchapter by reference, may be discharged by making payments in cash, by making contributions described in section 3141(2)(B)(i) of this title, by assuming an enforceable commitment to bear the costs of a plan or program referred to in section 3141(2)(B)(ii) of this title, or by any combination of payment, contribution, and assumption, where the aggregate of the payments, contributions, and costs is not less than the basic hourly rate of pay plus the amount referred to in section 3141(2)(B) of this title.

(B) only for the personal purpose or pleasure of the individual;

(C) without promise, expectation, or receipt of compensation for services rendered, except as provided in subsection (b); and

(D) freely and without pressure or coercion, direct or implied, from any employer;


(2) whose contribution of service is not for the direct or indirect benefit of any contractor otherwise performing or seeking to perform work on the same project for which the individual is volunteering;

(3) who is not employed by and does not provide services to a contractor or subcontractor at any time on the federally assisted or insured project for which the individual is volunteering; and

(4) who otherwise is not employed by the same public agency or recipient of federal assistance to perform the same type of services as those for which the individual proposes to volunteer.


(b) Payments.—(1) In accordance with regulations.—Volunteers described in subsection (a) who are performing services directly to a state or local government or public agency may receive payments of expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee only in accordance with regulations the Secretary of Labor prescribes. Volunteers who are performing services directly to a public or private nonprofit entity may not receive those payments.

(2) Criteria and content of regulations.—In prescribing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider criteria such as the total amount of payments made (relating to expenses, benefits, or fees) in the context of the economic realities. The regulations shall include provisions that provide that—(A) a payment for an expense may be received by a volunteer for items such as uniform allowances, protective gear and clothing, reimbursement for approximate out-of-pocket expenses, or the cost or expense of meals and transportation;

(B) a reasonable benefit may include the inclusion of a volunteer in a group insurance plan (such as a liability, health, life, disability, or worker’s compensation plan) or pension plan, or the awarding of a length of service award; and

(3) Nominal fee.—The Secretary shall decide what constitutes a nominal fee for purposes of paragraph (2)(C). The decision shall be based on the context of the economic realities of the situation involved.


(c) Economic Reality.—In determining whether an expense, benefit, or fee described in subsection (b) may be paid to volunteers in the context of the economic realities of the particular situation, the Secretary may not permit any expense, benefit, or fee that has the effect of undermining labor standards by creating downward pressure on prevailing wages in the local construction industry.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) [see 54 U.S.C. 300101 et seq.] and the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) [title I of Pub. L. 94–541, see 40 U.S.C. 3306 and Tables for classification], and in furtherance of and consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of August 16, 1978 [40 U.S.C. 121 note], and Executive Order No. 11593 of May 13, 1971 [54 U.S.C. 300101 note], it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Statement of Policy. Through the Administration’s community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation’s cities by encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.
To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.
Sec. 2. Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Central Cities. When operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122) [now 7 U.S.C. 2204b–1], and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties.
Sec. 3. Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers. Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the Federal Government’s ability to establish or maintain a presence in historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these steps.
Sec. 4. Improving Preservation Partnerships. In carrying out the authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.
Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

(2) Exception.—The Administrator may lease space with respect to which paragraph (1) applies if the Administrator—(A) decides, for reasons set forth in writing, that leasing the space is necessary to meet requirements which cannot be met in public buildings; and

(B) submits the reasons to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

Ex. Ord. No. 13728. Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation
Ex. Ord. No. 13728, May 18, 2016, 81 F.R. 32223, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to improve the Nation’s resilience to wildfire, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the security and resilience of the Nation against the impacts of wildfire. The annual estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically over the past six decades as a result of multi-year drought conditions in combination with accumulated fuel loads, growing populations residing in the wildland-urban interface, and associated increases in the exposure of built environments. As such, we must continue to ensure our Nation is resilient to wildfire in order to promote public safety, economic strength, and national security.
The Federal Government must continue to take proactive steps to enhance the resilience of buildings that are owned by the Federal Government and are located on Federal land. Each executive department and agency (agency) responsible for implementing this order shall seek to enhance the resilience of its buildings when making investment decisions to ensure continued performance of essential functions and to reduce risks to its buildings’ occupants in the event of a wildfire.
Sec. 2. Codes and Concurrent Requirements. (a) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency shall ensure that every new Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with the 2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.
(b) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency responsible for the alteration of an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design shall ensure that the alteration is effectuated in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.
(c) Each agency that owns an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that such existing buildings are in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.
(d) The heads of agencies whose activities are covered by sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order shall complete a wildfire risk assessment of their existing Federal buildings above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface and are strongly encouraged to consider creating and maintaining a defensible space in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, for each of those buildings they determine to be at highest risk.
(e) Each agency that leases space in a building to be constructed for the predominant use of an agency above 5,000 rentable square feet in the wildland-urban interface in an area of greater than moderate wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that the building is designed and constructed in accord with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.
(f) Each agency assisting in the financing, through Federal grants or loans, or guaranteeing the financing, through loan or mortgage insurance premiums, of a newly constructed building or of an alteration of an existing building above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk shall consider updating its procedures for providing the assistance to be consistent with sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order, to ensure appropriate consideration of wildfire-resistant design and construction.
(g) To the extent permitted by law, the heads of all agencies may:
(i) require higher performance levels than exist in the codes described in section 2(a) of this order;
(ii) apply the requirements within section 2(a) of this order to new buildings less than 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk; and
(iii) apply the requirements within section 2(b) of this order to existing buildings less than 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk.
(h) When calculating whether a building is at moderate or greater wildfire risk, agencies should act in accordance with the methods described in the 2015 edition of the IWUIC, or any subsequent version that is determined to be a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), or an equivalent code, or in accordance with an equivalent method.
(i) Each building constructed or altered in accordance with section 2(a) or (b) of this order shall comply with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, only to the maximum extent feasible as determined by the head of an agency.
Sec. 3. Agency Responsibilities. (a) The heads of all agencies that own Federal buildings above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk shall determine the appropriate process within their respective agencies to ensure compliance with this order.
(b) The Mitigation Framework Leadership Group (MitFLG) shall:
(i) create implementing guidelines to advise and assist agency compliance with the code requirements within 240 days of the date of this order;
(ii) provide assistance to the agencies in interpreting the implementing guidelines.
(c) When determining whether buildings are located within the wildland-urban interface, agencies shall use the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service’s, “The 2010 Wildland-Urban Interface of the Conterminous United States,” or an equivalent tool. The Secretary of Agriculture shall provide assistance to the agencies in determining whether buildings are located within the wildland-urban interface.
(d) The heads of agencies whose activities are covered by sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order shall submit a report once every 2 years to the Chair of the MitFLG on their progress in implementing the order, commencing 2 years from the date of this order.
Sec. 4. Definition. As used in this order, “building” means a constructed asset that is enclosed with walls and a roof that provides space for agencies to perform activities or store materials as well as provides spaces for people to live or work.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law, including the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order applies only to buildings within the United States and its territories and possessions.
(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(2) Amount directed to be withheld.—The officer or individual whose duty it is to approve the payment of money by the Government, territory, or District of Columbia in connection with the performance of the contract work shall direct the amount of—(A) liquidated damages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the Government, territory, or District; and

(B) unpaid wages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the laborers and mechanics who were not compensated as required under this chapter.


(3) Payment.—The Secretary of Labor shall pay the amount administratively determined to be due directly to the laborers and mechanics from amounts withheld on account of underpayments of wages if the amount withheld is adequate. If the amount withheld is not adequate, the Secretary of Labor shall pay an equitable proportion of the amount due.


(c) Right of Action and Intervention Against Contractors and Sureties.—If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and mechanics who have not been paid the wages required under this chapter, the laborers and mechanics, in the case of a department or agency of the Government, have the same right of action and intervention against the contractor and the contractor’s sureties as is conferred by law on persons furnishing labor or materials. In those proceedings it is not a defense that the laborers and mechanics accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.

(d) Review Process.—(1) Time limit for appeal.—Within 60 days after an amount is withheld as liquidated damages, any contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by the withholding may appeal to the head of the agency of the Government or territory for which the contract work is done or which is providing financial assistance for the work, or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the case of liquidated damages withheld for the use and benefit of the District.

(2) Review by agency head or mayor.—The agency head or Mayor may review the administrative determination of liquidated damages. The agency head or Mayor may issue a final order affirming the determination or may recommend to the Secretary of Labor that an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages be made, or that the contractor or subcontractor be relieved of liability for the liquidated damages, if it is found that the amount is incorrect or that the contractor or subcontractor violated this chapter inadvertently, notwithstanding the exercise of due care by the contractor or subcontractor and the agents of the contractor or subcontractor.

(3) Review by secretary.—The Secretary shall review all pertinent facts in the matter and may conduct any investigation the Secretary considers necessary in order to affirm or reject the recommendation. The decision of the Secretary is final.

(4) Judicial action.—A contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by a final order for the withholding of liquidated damages may file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims within 60 days after the final order. A final order of the agency head, Mayor, or Secretary is conclusive with respect to findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence.

In this chapter, the word “Mayor” is substituted for “Commissioners” [meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia] [subsequently changed to “Commissioner” [meaning the Commissioner of the District of Columbia] because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public Law 93–198, 87 Stat. 789). The words “Council of the District of Columbia” are substituted for “Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia” [subsequently changed to “District of Columbia Council” because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87 Stat. 785, 787).
In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words “the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives” are substituted for “and the chairman of the Committees of the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives” in section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the “Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977”), approved February 4, 1977, section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104–14, 2:21 note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th Congress, January 6, 1999).

In subsection (d), the words “chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53” are substituted for “the civil service and classification laws” because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89–554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.
In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words “As hereinafter more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title” are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff. Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words “in such capacity” are omitted as unnecessary.
Subsection (f) is substituted for 40:71h to eliminate obsolete language.
In subsection (g), the words “Said Commission shall report to Congress annually on the first Monday of March the lands acquired during the preceding fiscal year, the method of acquisition, and the cost of each tract” are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note). See, also, page 180 of House Document No. 103–7. The words “Office of Management and Budget” are substituted for “Bureau of the Budget” in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.

The Commission may include in its plan any part of a plan adopted by any planning agency in the environs and may make recommendations of collateral interest to the agencies. The Commission may adopt any part of an element. The Commission shall review and may amend or extend the plan so that its recommendations may be kept up to date.

(b) Review by District of Columbia.—The Mayor of the District of Columbia shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan, and any amendment, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings.

(3) Negative impact.—(A) Certification to council.—If the Commission finds a negative impact, it shall certify its findings and recommendations to the Council.

(B) Response of council.—On receipt of the Commission’s findings and recommendations, the Council may—(i) accept the findings and recommendations and modify the element or amendment accordingly; or

(ii) reject the findings and recommendations and resubmit a modified form of the element or amendment to the Commission for reconsideration.


(C) Findings and recommendations accepted.—If the Council accepts the findings and recommendations and modifies the element or amendment, the Council shall submit the element or amendment to the Commission for the Commission to determine whether the modification has been made in accordance with the Commission’s findings and recommendations. If the Commission does not act on the modified element or amendment within 30 days after receiving it, the element or amendment is deemed to have been modified in accordance with the findings and recommendations and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and implemented. If within the 30-day period the Commission again determines the element or amendment has a negative impact on the functions or interests of the federal establishment in the National Capital, the element or amendment shall not be implemented.

(D) Findings and recommendations rejected.—If the Council rejects the findings and recommendations and resubmits a modified element or amendment, the Commission, within 60 days after receiving it, shall decide whether the modified element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment within the National Capital. If the Commission does not act within the 60-day period, the modified element or amendment is deemed to have no negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and implemented. If the Commission finds a negative impact, it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council and the element or amendment shall not be implemented.



(d) Resubmission Deemed New Element or Amendment.—Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined has a negative impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital which is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission is deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.

(e) Review, Hearings, and Citizen Advisory Councils.—(1) Review.—Before the comprehensive plan, any element of the plan, or any revision is adopted, the Commission shall present the plan, element, or revision to the appropriate federal or District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations. The Commission may present the proposed revisions annually in a consolidated form. Recommendations by federal and District of Columbia authorities are not binding on the Commission, but the Commission shall give careful consideration to any views and recommendations submitted prior to final adoption.

(2) Hearings and citizen advisory councils.—The Commission—(A) may provide periodic opportunity for review and comments by nongovernmental agencies or groups through public hearings, meetings, or conferences, exhibitions, and publication of its plans; and

(B) in consultation with the Council, may encourage the formation of citizen advisory councils.



(f) Extension of Time Limitations.—On request of the Commission, the Council may grant an extension of any time limitation contained in this section.

(g) Publishing Comprehensive Plan.—As appropriate, the Commission and the Mayor jointly shall publish a comprehensive plan for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the comprehensive plan for the federal activities in the National Capital developed by the Commission and the District elements developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with this section.

(h) Procedures for Consultation.—(1) Commission and mayor.—The Commission and the Mayor jointly shall establish procedures for appropriate meaningful continuing consultation throughout the planning process for the National Capital.

§ 8722. Proposed federal and district developments and projects(a) Agencies To Use Commission as Central Planning Agency.—Agencies of the Federal Government responsible for public developments and projects shall cooperate and correlate their efforts by using the National Capital Planning Commission as the central planning agency for federal activities in the National Capital region. To aid the Commission in carrying out this function, federal and District of Columbia governmental agencies on request of the Commission shall furnish plans, data, and records the Commission requires. The Commission on request shall furnish related plans, data, and records to federal and District of Columbia governmental agencies.

(b) Consultation Between Agencies and Commission.—(1) Before construction plans prepared.—To ensure the comprehensive planning and orderly development of the National Capital, a federal or District of Columbia agency, before preparing construction plans the agency originates for proposed developments and projects or before making a commitment to acquire land, to be paid for at least in part from federal or District amounts, shall advise and consult with the Commission as the agency prepares plans and programs in preliminary and successive stages that affect the plan and development of the National Capital. After receiving the plans, maps, and data, the Commission promptly shall make a preliminary report and recommendations to the agency. If the agency, after considering the report and recommendations of the Commission, does not agree, it shall advise the Commission and provide the reasons why it does not agree. The Commission then shall submit a final report. After consultation and suitable consideration of the views of the Commission, the agency may proceed to take action in accordance with its legal responsibilities and authority.

(2) Exceptions.—(A) In general.—Paragraph (1) does not apply to projects within the Capitol grounds or to structures erected by the Department of Defense during wartime or national emergency within existing military, naval, or Air Force reservations, except that the appropriate defense agency shall consult with the Commission as to any developments which materially affect traffic or require coordinated planning of the surrounding area.

(B) Advance decisions of commission.—The Commission shall determine in advance the type or kinds of plans, developments, projects, improvements, or acquisitions which do not need to be submitted for review by the Commission as to conformity with its plans.



(c) Additional Procedure for Developments and Projects Within Environs.—(1) Submission to commission.—Within the environs, general plans showing the location, character, and extent of, and intensity of use for, proposed federal and District developments and projects involving the acquisition of land shall be submitted to the Commission for report and recommendations before a final commitment to the acquisition is made, unless the matter specifically has been approved by law.

(2) Commission action.—Before acting on any general plan, the Commission shall advise and consult with the appropriate planning agency having jurisdiction over the affected part of the environs. When the Commission decides that proposed developments or projects submitted to the Commission under subsection (b) involve a major change in the character or intensity of an existing use in the environs, the Commission shall advise and consult with the planning agency. The report and recommendations shall be submitted within 60 days and shall be accompanied by any reports or recommendations of the planning agency.

(3) Working with state or local authority or agency.—In carrying out its planning functions with respect to federal developments or projects in the environs, the Commission may work with, and make agreements with, any state or local authority or planning agency as the Commission considers necessary to have a plan or proposal adopted and carried out.


(d) Approval of Federal Public Buildings.—The provisions of the Act of June 20, 1938 (ch. 534, 52 Stat. 797) shall not apply to federal public buildings. In order to ensure the orderly development of the National Capital, the location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of federal public buildings in the District of Columbia and the provision for open space in and around federal public buildings in the District of Columbia are subject to the approval of the Commission.

(e) Approval of District Government Buildings in Central Area.—Subsection (d) is extended to include public buildings erected by any agency of the Government of the District of Columbia in the central area of the District (as defined by concurrent action of the Commission and the Council of the District of Columbia), except that the Commission shall transmit its approval or disapproval within 30 days after the day the proposal was submitted to the Commission.

§ 8732. Acquiring land subject to limited rights reserved to grantor and limited permanent rights in land adjoining park property(a) In General.—The National Capital Planning Commission in accordance with this chapter may acquire, for and on behalf of the Federal Government, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation—(1) fee title to land subject to limited rights, but not for business purposes, reserved to the grantor; and

(2) permanent rights in land adjoining park property sufficient to prevent the use of the land in certain specified ways which would essentially impair the value of the park property for its purposes.


(b) Prerequisites to Acquisition.—(1) Fee title to land subject to limited rights.—The reservation of rights to the grantor shall not continue beyond the life of the grantor of the fee. The Commission must decide that the permanent public park purposes for which control over the land is needed are not essentially impaired by the reserved rights and that there is a substantial saving in cost by acquiring the land subject to the limited rights as compared with the cost of acquiring unencumbered title to the land.

(2) Permanent rights in land adjoining park property.—The Commission must decide that the protection and maintenance of the essential public values of the park can be secured more economically by acquiring the permanent rights than by acquiring the land.


(c) Presidential Approval Required.—All contracts to acquire land or rights under this section are subject to the approval of the President.

Executive Documents

Ex. Ord. No. 13960. Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government
Ex. Ord. No. 13960, Dec. 3, 2020, 85 F.R. 78939, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to drive the growth of the United States economy and improve the quality of life of all Americans. In alignment with Executive Order 13859 of February 11, 2019 (Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence) [42 U.S.C. 6601 note], executive departments and agencies (agencies) have recognized the power of AI to improve their operations, processes, and procedures; meet strategic goals; reduce costs; enhance oversight of the use of taxpayer funds; increase efficiency and mission effectiveness; improve quality of services; improve safety; train workforces; and support decision making by the Federal workforce, among other positive developments. Given the broad applicability of AI, nearly every agency and those served by those agencies can benefit from the appropriate use of AI.
Agencies are already leading the way in the use of AI by applying it to accelerate regulatory reform; review Federal solicitations for regulatory compliance; combat fraud, waste, and abuse committed against taxpayers; identify information security threats and assess trends in related illicit activities; enhance the security and interoperability of Federal Government information systems; facilitate review of large datasets; streamline processes for grant applications; model weather patterns; facilitate predictive maintenance; and much more.
Agencies are encouraged to continue to use AI, when appropriate, to benefit the American people. The ongoing adoption and acceptance of AI will depend significantly on public trust. Agencies must therefore design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that fosters public trust and confidence while protecting privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and American values, consistent with applicable law and the goals of Executive Order 13859.
Certain agencies have already adopted guidelines and principles for the use of AI for national security or defense purposes, such as the Department of Defense’s Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence (February 24, 2020), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s Principles of Artificial Intelligence Ethics for the Intelligence Community (July 23, 2020) and its Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework for the Intelligence Community (July 23, 2020). Such guidelines and principles ensure that the use of AI in those contexts will benefit the American people and be worthy of their trust.
Section 3 of this order establishes additional principles (Principles) for the use of AI in the Federal Government for purposes other than national security and defense, to similarly ensure that such uses are consistent with our Nation’s values and are beneficial to the public. This order further establishes a process for implementing these Principles through common policy guidance across agencies.
Sec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of AI, where appropriate, to improve Government operations and services in a manner that fosters public trust, builds confidence in AI, protects our Nation’s values, and remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
(b) It is the policy of the United States that responsible agencies, as defined in section 8 of this order, shall, when considering the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI in Government, be guided by the common set of Principles set forth in section 3 of this order, which are designed to foster public trust and confidence in the use of AI, protect our Nation’s values, and ensure that the use of AI remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
(c) It is the policy of the United States that the Principles for the use of AI in Government shall be governed by common policy guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as outlined in section 4 of this order, consistent with applicable law.
Sec. 3. Principles for Use of AI in Government. When designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI in the Federal Government, agencies shall adhere to the following Principles:
(a) Lawful and respectful of our Nation’s values. Agencies shall design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that exhibits due respect for our Nation’s values and is consistent with the Constitution and all other applicable laws and policies, including those addressing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
(b) Purposeful and performance-driven. Agencies shall seek opportunities for designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI, where the benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the risks, and the risks can be assessed and managed.
(c) Accurate, reliable, and effective. Agencies shall ensure that their application of AI is consistent with the use cases for which that AI was trained, and such use is accurate, reliable, and effective.
(d) Safe, secure, and resilient. Agencies shall ensure the safety, security, and resiliency of their AI applications, including resilience when confronted with systematic vulnerabilities, adversarial manipulation, and other malicious exploitation.
(e) Understandable. Agencies shall ensure that the operations and outcomes of their AI applications are sufficiently understandable by subject matter experts, users, and others, as appropriate.
(f) Responsible and traceable. Agencies shall ensure that human roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, understood, and appropriately assigned for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. Agencies shall ensure that AI is used in a manner consistent with these Principles and the purposes for which each use of AI is intended. The design, development, acquisition, and use of AI, as well as relevant inputs and outputs of particular AI applications, should be well documented and traceable, as appropriate and to the extent practicable.
(g) Regularly monitored. Agencies shall ensure that their AI applications are regularly tested against these Principles. Mechanisms should be maintained to supersede, disengage, or deactivate existing applications of AI that demonstrate performance or outcomes that are inconsistent with their intended use or this order.
(h) Transparent. Agencies shall be transparent in disclosing relevant information regarding their use of AI to appropriate stakeholders, including the Congress and the public, to the extent practicable and in accordance with applicable laws and policies, including with respect to the protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information.
(i) Accountable. Agencies shall be accountable for implementing and enforcing appropriate safeguards for the proper use and functioning of their applications of AI, and shall monitor, audit, and document compliance with those safeguards. Agencies shall provide appropriate training to all agency personnel responsible for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI.
Sec. 4. Implementation of Principles. (a) Existing OMB policies currently address many aspects of information and information technology design, development, acquisition, and use that apply, but are not unique, to AI. To the extent they are consistent with the Principles set forth in this order and applicable law, these existing policies shall continue to apply to relevant aspects of AI use in Government.
(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order [Dec. 3, 2020], the Director of OMB (Director), in coordination with key stakeholders identified by the Director, shall publicly post a roadmap for the policy guidance that OMB intends to create or revise to better support the use of AI, consistent with this order. This roadmap shall include, where appropriate, a schedule for engaging with the public and timelines for finalizing relevant policy guidance. In addressing novel aspects of the use of AI in Government, OMB shall consider updates to the breadth of its policy guidance, including OMB Circulars and Management Memoranda.
(c) Agencies shall continue to use voluntary consensus standards developed with industry participation, where available, when such use would not be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impracticable. Such standards shall also be taken into consideration by OMB when revising or developing AI guidance.
Sec. 5. Agency Inventory of AI Use Cases. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council (CIO Council), in coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, shall identify, provide guidance on, and make publicly available the criteria, format, and mechanisms for agency inventories of non-classified and non-sensitive use cases of AI by agencies.
(b) Within 180 days of the CIO Council’s completion of the directive in section 5(a) of this order, and annually thereafter, each agency shall prepare an inventory of its non-classified and non-sensitive use cases of AI, within the scope defined by section 9 of this order, including current and planned uses, consistent with the agency’s mission.
(c) As part of their respective inventories of AI use cases, agencies shall identify, review, and assess existing AI deployed and operating in support of agency missions for any inconsistencies with this order.

Ex Ord. No. 13833. Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers
Ex. Ord. No. 13833, May 15, 2018, 83 F.R. 23345, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. The Federal Government spends more than $90 billion annually on information technology (IT). The vast majority of this sum is consumed in maintaining legacy IT infrastructure that is often ineffective and more costly than modern technologies. Modern IT systems would enable agencies to reduce costs, mitigate cybersecurity risks, and deliver improved services to the American people. While the recently enacted Modernizing Government Technology Act [probably means subtitle G of title X of div. A of Pub. L. 115–91, set out as a note under section 11301 of this title] will provide needed financial resources to help transition agencies to more effective, efficient, and secure technologies, more can be done to improve management of IT resources. Department and agency (agency) Chief Information Officers (CIOs) generally do not have adequate visibility into, or control over, their agencies’ IT resources, resulting in duplication, waste, and poor service delivery. Enhancing the effectiveness of agency CIOs will better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, reduce cybersecurity risks, and serve the American people well.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:
(a) empower agency CIOs to ensure that agency IT systems are secure, efficient, accessible, and effective, and that such systems enable agencies to accomplish their missions;
(b) modernize IT infrastructure within the executive branch and meaningfully improve the delivery of digital services; and
(c) improve the management, acquisition, and oversight of Federal IT.
Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term “covered agency” means an agency listed in 31 U.S.C. 901(b), other than the Department of Defense or any agency considered to be an “independent regulatory agency” as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5);
(b) the term “information technology” has the meaning given that term in 40 U.S.C. 11101(6);
(c) the term “Chief Information Officer” or “CIO” means the individual within a covered agency as described in 40 U.S.C. 11315;
(d) the term “component Chief Information Officer” or “component CIO” means an individual in a covered agency, other than the CIO referred to in subsection (c) of this section, who has the title Chief Information Officer, or who functions in the capacity of a CIO, and has IT management authorities over a component of the agency similar to those the CIO has over the entire agency;
(e) the term “IT position” means a position within the job family standard for the Information Technology Management Series, GS–2210, as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families and related guidance.
Sec. 4. Emphasizing Chief Information Officer Duties and Responsibilities. The head of each covered agency shall take all necessary and appropriate action to ensure that:
(a) consistent with 44 U.S.C. 3506(a)(2), the CIO of the covered agency reports directly to the agency head, such that the CIO has direct access to the agency head regarding all programs that include IT;
(b) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11315(b), and to promote the effective, efficient, and secure use of IT to accomplish the agency’s mission, the CIO serves as the primary strategic advisor to the agency head concerning the use of IT;
(c) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11319(b)(1)(A), the CIO has a significant role, including, as appropriate, as lead advisor, in all annual and multi-year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions, as well as in all management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT; and
(d) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11319(b)(2) and other applicable law, the CIO of the covered agency approves the appointment of any component CIO in that agency.
Sec. 5. Agency-wide IT Consolidation. Consistent with the purposes of Executive Order 13781 of March 13, 2017 (Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch) [82 F.R. 13959], the head of each covered agency shall take all necessary and appropriate action to:
(a) eliminate unnecessary IT management functions;
(b) merge or reorganize agency IT functions to promote agency-wide consolidation of the agency’s IT infrastructure, taking into account any recommendations of the relevant agency CIO; and
(c) increase use of industry best practices, such as the shared use of IT solutions within agencies and across the executive branch.
Sec. 6. Strengthening Cybersecurity. Consistent with the purposes of Executive Order 13800 of May 11, 2017 (Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure) [6 U.S.C. note prec. 1500], the head of each covered agency shall take all necessary and appropriate action to ensure that:
(a) the CIO, as the principal advisor to the agency head for the management of IT resources, works closely with an integrated team of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources to implement appropriate risk management measures; and
(b) the agency prioritizes procurement of shared IT services, including modern email and other cloud-based services, where possible and to the extent permitted by law.
Sec. 7. Knowledge and Skill Standards for IT Personnel. The head of each covered agency shall take all necessary and appropriate action to ensure that:
(a) consistent with 40 U.S.C. 11315(c)(3), the CIO assesses and advises the agency head regarding knowledge and skill standards established for agency IT personnel;
(b) the established knowledge and skill standards are included in the performance standards and reflected in the performance evaluations of all component CIOs, and that the CIO is responsible for that portion of the evaluation; and
(c) all component CIOs apply those standards within their own components.
Sec. 8. Chief Information Officer Role on IT Governance Boards. Wherever appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the head of each covered agency shall ensure that the CIO shall be a member of any investment or related board of the agency with purview over IT, or any board responsible for setting agency-wide IT standards. The head of each covered agency shall also, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, direct the CIO to chair any such board. To the extent any such board operates through member votes, the head of each covered agency shall also, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, direct the CIO to fulfill the role of voting member.
Sec. 9. Chief Information Officer Hiring Authorities. The Director of OPM (Director) shall publish a proposed rule delegating to the head of each covered agency authority to determine whether there is a severe shortage of candidates (or, with respect to the Department of Veterans Affairs, that there exists a severe shortage of highly qualified candidates), or that a critical hiring need exists, for IT positions at the covered agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3304(a)(3), under criteria established by OPM.
(a) Such proposed rule shall provide that, upon an affirmative determination by the head of a covered agency that there is a severe shortage of candidates (or, with respect to the Department of Veterans Affairs, that there exists a severe shortage of highly qualified candidates), or that a critical hiring need exists for IT positions, under the criteria established by OPM, the Director shall, within 30 days, grant that agency direct hiring authority for IT positions.
(b) Such proposed rule shall further provide that employees hired using this authority may not be transferred to positions that are not IT positions; that the employees shall initially be given term appointments not to exceed 4 years; and that the terms of such employees may be extended up to 4 additional years at the discretion of the hiring agency.
(c) The Director shall submit the proposed rule for publication within 30 days of the date of this order [May 15, 2018].
Sec. 10. Guidance. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall amend or replace relevant guidance, as appropriate, to agencies to reflect the requirements of this order.
Sec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

14101.Findings and purposes.


14102.Definitions.



§ 14101. Findings and purposes(a) 1965 Findings and Purpose.—(1) Findings.—Congress finds and declares that the Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation’s prosperity. The region’s uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working, and will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution. Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President’s Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed.

(2) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders that will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.


(b) 1975 Findings and Purpose.—(1) Findings.—Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975, is assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of December 31, 1975, has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal, the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-industrial development, which promotes both employment and economic growth and the preservation of natural resources. Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs to the region and its people.

(2) Purpose.—It is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward—(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;

(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and

(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation’s energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.



(c) 1998 Findings and Purpose.—(1) Findings.—Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the objectives of this subtitle, rapidly changing national and global economies over the decade ending November 13, 1998, have created new problems and challenges for rural areas throughout the United States and especially for the Appalachian region.

(2) Purpose.—In addition to the purposes stated in subsections (a) and (b), it is the purpose of this subtitle—(A) to assist the Appalachian region in—(i) providing the infrastructure necessary for economic and human resource development;

(ii) developing the region’s industry;

(iii) building entrepreneurial communities;

(iv) generating a diversified regional economy; and

(v) making the region’s industrial and commercial resources more competitive in national and world markets;


(B) to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state, and local initiatives to respond to the economic competitiveness challenges in the Appalachian region through—(i) improving the skills of the region’s workforce;

(ii) adapting and applying new technologies for the region’s businesses, including eco-industrial development technologies; and

(iii) improving the access of the region’s businesses to the technical and financial resources necessary to development of the businesses; and


(C) to address the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus special attention on the areas of greatest need so as to provide a fairer opportunity for the people of the region to share the quality of life generally enjoyed by citizens across the United States.

SUBCHAPTER I—PROGRAMS
§ 14501. Appalachian development highway system(a) Purpose.—To provide a highway system which, in conjunction with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the Appalachian region, will open up an area with a developmental potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access, the Secretary of Transportation may assist in the construction of an Appalachian development highway system and local access roads serving the Appalachian region. Construction on the development highway system shall not be more than three thousand and ninety miles. There shall not be more than 1,400 miles of local access roads that serve specific recreational, residential, educational, commercial, industrial, or similar facilities or facilitate a school consolidation program.

(b) Commission Designations.—(1) What is to be designated.—The Appalachian Regional Commission shall transmit to the Secretary its designations of—(A) the general corridor location and termini of the development highways;

(B) local access roads to be constructed;

(C) priorities for the construction of segments of the development highways; and

(2) State transportation department recommendation required.—Before a state member participates in or votes on designations, the member must obtain the recommendations of the state transportation department of the State which the member represents.


(c) Addition to Federal-aid Primary System.—When completed, each development highway not already on the Federal-aid primary system shall be added to the system.

(d) Use of Specific Materials and Products.—(1) Indigenous materials and products.—In the construction of highways and roads authorized under this section, a State may give special preference to the use of materials and products indigenous to the Appalachian region.

(2) Coal derivatives.—For research and development in the use of coal and coal products in highway construction and maintenance, the Secretary may require each participating State, to the maximum extent possible, to use coal derivatives in the construction of not more than 10 percent of the roads authorized under this subtitle.


(e) Federal Share.—Federal assistance to any construction project under this section shall not be more than 80 percent of the cost of the project.

(f) Construction Without Federal Amounts.—(1) Payment of federal share.—When a participating State constructs a segment of a development highway without the aid of federal amounts and the construction is in accordance with all procedures and requirements applicable to the construction of segments of Appalachian development highways with those amounts, except for procedures and requirements that limit a State to the construction of projects for which federal amounts have previously been appropriated, the Secretary, on application by the State and with the approval of the Commission, may pay to the State the federal share, which shall not be more than 80 percent of the cost of the construction of the segment, from any amounts appropriated and allocated to the State to carry out this section.

(2) No commitment or obligation.—This subsection does not commit or obligate the Federal Government to provide amounts for segments of development highways constructed under this subsection.


(g) Application of Title 23.—(1) Sections 106(a) and 118.—Sections 106(a) and 118 of title 23 apply to the development highway system and the local access roads.

SUBCHAPTER II—ADMINISTRATIVE
§ 14521. Required level of expenditure
A State or political subdivision of a State is not eligible to receive benefits under this subtitle unless the aggregate expenditure of state amounts, except expenditures for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and local and federal amounts, for the benefit of the area within the State located in the Appalachian region is maintained at a level which does not fall below the average level of those expenditures for the State’s last two full fiscal years prior to March 9, 1965. In computing the level, a State’s past expenditure for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and expenditures of local and federal amounts shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the President a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial population decrease in that part of a State which lies within the region would not justify a state expenditure equal to the average level of the last two years or when it finds that a State’s average level of expenditure in an individual program has been disproportionate to the present need for that part of the State.

§ 17501. Definitions
In this chapter, the following definitions apply:(1) Executive agency.—The term “executive agency”—(A) means an executive agency (as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5) that operates at least 300 motor vehicles; but

(B) does not include the Tennessee Valley Authority.


(2) Motor vehicle.—The term “motor vehicle” means—(A) a vehicle self-propelled or drawn by mechanical power; but not

(B) a vehicle designed or used for military field training, combat, or tactical purposes, or any other special purpose vehicle exempted from the requirements of this chapter by the Administrator of General Services.

In this section, the text of 40:913(2)–(4) is omitted as unnecessary because the complete names of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General Services, and the Comptroller General of the United States are used the first time the terms appear in a section.
Before clause (1), the words “this chapter” were in the original “this title”, meaning title XV (§§ 15101 to 15313) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–272, 100 Stat. 330). In clause (2)(B), the words “this chapter” are substituted for “this part” as the probable intent of Congress because title XV of the Act does not contain part designations and the intention was probably to refer to title XV, which is restated as this chapter.



§ 17502. Monitoring system
The head of each executive agency shall designate one office, officer, or employee of the agency—(1) to establish and operate a central monitoring system for the motor vehicle operations of the agency, related activities, and related reporting requirements; and

(2) provide oversight of those operations, activities, and requirements.

17903.Purchase of electric power.


17904.Implementation powers and limitations.



§ 17901. Definitions
In this chapter, the following definitions apply:(1) Federal agency.—The term “federal agency” means a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.

(2) Federally generated electric energy.—The term “federally generated electric energy” means any electric power generated by an electric generating facility owned and operated by a federal agency.

In clause (1), the definition of “agency” as referring to the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government is rewritten as a definition of “federal agency” to avoid confusion between the role of the “agency” and the “head of the agency”. Throughout the chapter, the words “head of the federal agency” are used when the source provision is referring to action taken by an official as opposed to the concept of the agency as an institution.
In clause (3), the text of 40:795(1) and (4) is combined to eliminate a definition (40:795(1)) that is used only once.



§ 17902. Sale of electric energy(a) In General.—To conserve oil and natural gas and better utilize coal, the head of a federal agency may sell, or enter into a contract to sell, to any non-federal person electric energy generated by coal-fired electric generating facilities of that agency in Alaska without regard to any provision of law that precludes the sale when the electric energy to be sold is available from other local sources, if the head of the federal agency determines that—(1) the electric energy to be sold is generated by an existing coal-fired generating facility;

(2) the electric energy to be sold is surplus to the federal agency’s needs and is in excess of the electric energy specifically generated for consumption by, or necessary to serve the requirements of, another federal agency;

(3) the cost to the ultimate consumers of the electric energy to be sold is less than the cost that, in the absence of the sale, would be incurred by those consumers for the purchase of an equivalent amount of energy; and

(4) the sale will reduce the total consumption of oil or natural gas by the non-federal person purchasing the electric energy below the level of consumption that would occur in the absence of the sale.


(b) Pricing Policies.—Federally generated electric energy sold by the head of a federal agency under subsection (a) shall be priced to recover the fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs of the facility generating the energy that are attributable to that sale, plus an amount equal to one-half the difference between—(1) the costs of producing the electric energy by coal generation; and

(2) the costs of producing electric energy by the oil or gas generation being displaced.

§ 17903. Purchase of electric power
For purposes of economy, efficiency, and conserving oil and natural gas, the head of a federal agency, when practicable and consistent with other laws and requirements applicable to that agency, shall endeavor to purchase electric energy from a non-federal person for consumption in Alaska by a facility of that agency when (taking into account the remaining useful life of any facility available to that agency to generate electric energy for that agency and the cost of maintaining the facility on a standby basis) the purchase will result in—(1) a savings to other consumers of electric energy sold by that non-federal person without increasing the cost incurred by any federal agency for electric energy; or

(2) a cost savings to the federal agency purchasing the electric energy without increasing costs to other consumers of electric energy.

CHAPTER 183—NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA INTEREST ARBITRATION STANDARDS



Sec.


18301.Findings and purposes.


18302.Definitions.


18303.Standards for arbitrators.


18304.Procedures for enforcement of awards.



§ 18301. Findings and purposes(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation’s capital;

(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;

(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;

(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;

(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;

(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and

(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.


(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.

§ 18302. Definitions
In this chapter, the following definitions apply:(1) Arbitration.—The term “arbitration”—(A) means the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; but

(B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement.


(2) Arbitrator.—The term “arbitrator” refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures.

(3) Interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area.—The term “interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area” means any interstate compact agency that provides public transit services and that was established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory.

§ 18303. Standards for arbitrators(a) Definition.—In this section, the term “public welfare” includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact—(1) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and

(2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.


(b) Factors in Making Arbitration Award.—An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.

(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.

(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.

(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.

(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including—(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;

(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and

(C) the continuity and stability of employment.


(7) The public welfare.


(c) Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award.—An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency.

(d) Requirements for Final Award.—(1) Written award.—In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.

(2) Prerequisites.—An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.

(3) Substantial evidence.—The arbitrator’s conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.

After the end of that 10-day period, the award, and any modifications, become binding on the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees’ representative.

(b) Implementation.—Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award.

(c) Judicial Review.—Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may bring a civil action in a court that has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if—(1) the award is in violation of applicable law;

(2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’s powers;
