The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)–(17) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. Where established uses conflict, a choice has been made.
In clause (1), the definition of “Territory” in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.
In clause (2), a definition of “National Guard” is inserted for clarity.
In clause (3)(A), the words “a land force” are substituted for 32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, § 117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, § 3, 43 Stat. 1081.
In clauses (3) and (4), the word “Army” is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.
In clauses (3) and (5), the words “unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires—” and “as provided in this title”, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.
In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words “has its officers appointed” are substituted for the word “officered”, in 32:4b.
In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.
In clause (5)(A), the words “an air force” are substituted for the words “for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law”, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to Army National Guard), to make the definition of “Air National Guard” parallel with the definition of “Army National Guard”, and to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.
In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are inserted to make clear that enlistment is not the only method of becoming a member in an enlisted grade.

In clause (2), the term “armed forces” is defined for legislative convenience and is defined the same as that term is defined in section 101(4) of title 10, United States Code.
The definition in clause (18) reflects the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the term has been commonly used.

Official Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as Birthplace of the National Guard of the United StatesPub. L. 112–241, § 1, Jan. 10, 2013, 126 Stat. 2372, provided that:
“(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:“(1) In 1629, Captain John Endicott organized the first militia in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Salem.

“(2) The colonists had adopted the English militia system, which required all males between the ages of 16 and 60 to possess arms and participate in the defense of the community.

“(3) In 1636, the Massachusetts General Court ordered the organization of three militia regiments, designated as the North, South, and East regiments.

“(4) These regiments drilled once a week and provided guard details each evening to sound the alarm in case of attack.

“(5) The East Regiment, the predecessor of the 101st Engineer Battalion, assembled as a regiment for the first time in 1637 on the Salem Common, marking the beginning of the Massachusetts National Guard and the National Guard of the United States.

“(6) Since 1785, Salem’s own Second Corps of Cadets (101st and 102nd Field Artillery) has celebrated the anniversary of that first muster.

“(7) As the policy contained in section 102 of title 32, United States Code, clearly expresses, the National Guard continues its historic mission of providing units for the first line defense of the United States and current missions throughout the world.

“(8) The designation of the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States will contribute positively to tourism and economic development in the city, create jobs, and instill pride in both the local and State communities.


“(b) Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as National Guard Birthplace.—In light of the findings made in subsection (a), the City of Salem, Massachusetts, is hereby designated as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.

“(c) Responsibilities.—“(1) Military ceremonial support.—The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Council of Governors, and the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts, shall provide military ceremonial support at the dedication of any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.

“(2) Funding source.—Federal funds may not be used to design, procure, prepare, install, or maintain any monument, plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States, but the Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts may accept and expend contributions of non-Federal funds for this purpose.”







§ 102. General policy
In accordance with the traditional military policy of the United States, it is essential that the strength and organization of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard as an integral part of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times. Whenever Congress determines that more units and organizations are needed for the national security than are in the regular components of the ground and air forces, the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States, or such parts of them as are needed, together with such units of other reserve components as are necessary for a balanced force, shall be ordered to active Federal duty and retained as long as so needed.

§ 104. Units: location; organization; command(a) Each State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands may fix the location of the units and headquarters of its National Guard.

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the organization of the Army National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Army, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Army may authorize; and the organization of the Air National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Air Force, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize.

In subsection (a) the words “ceases to have the qualifications prescribed under section 300 of this title” are substituted for 32:154 (last 26 words of last par.), since it is implicit that a member who could not be paid would lose his federally recognized status (see JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953). The last 23 words of subsection (a) are inserted as a necessary implication of the rule stated in section 309(c) of this title.
In subsection (b), the words “or warrant officer” are omitted, since section 101(9) of this title defines “officer” to include warrant officers. The word “detailed” is substituted for the word “appointed”, since the filling of the positions involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word “commissioned” is inserted after the words “composed of”, since the word “officer” alone, in 32:115, referred to a commissioned officer only (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)). The words “who outrank him” are substituted for the words “senior in rank to the officer under investigation”.
In subsection (c), the opening clause is substituted for the words “such transfer”. The words “his Federal recognition is withdrawn” are substituted for the words “shall terminate his federally recognized National Guard or Air National Guard status”.

§ 710. Accountability for property issued to the National Guard(a) All military property issued by the United States to the National Guard remains the property of the United States.

(b) The Secretary of the Army shall prescribe regulations for accounting for property issued by the United States to the Army National Guard and for the fixing of responsibility for that property. The Secretary of the Air Force shall prescribe regulations for accounting for property issued by the United States to the Air National Guard and for the fixing of responsibility for that property. So far as practicable, regulations prescribed under this section shall be uniform among the components of each service.

(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned under subsection (b), liability for the value of property issued by the United States to the National Guard that is lost, damaged, or destroyed may be charged (1) to a member of the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard when in similar circumstances a member of the Army or Air Force serving on active duty would be so charged, or (2) to a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands when the property is lost, damaged, or destroyed incident to duty directed pursuant to the laws of, and in support of the authorities of, such jurisdiction. Liability charged to a member of the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard shall be paid out of pay due to the member for duties performed as a member of the National Guard, unless the Secretary concerned shall for good cause remit or cancel that liability. Liability charged to a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands shall be paid from its funds or from any other non-Federal funds.

(d) If property surveyed under this section is found to be unserviceable or unsuitable, the Secretary concerned or his designated representative shall direct its disposition by sale or otherwise. The proceeds of the following under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury under section 4(b)(22) of the Permanent Appropriation Repeal Act, 1934:(1) A sale.

(2) A stoppage against a member of the National Guard.

(3) A collection from a person, or from a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, to reimburse the United States for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, the property.


(e) If a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, whichever is concerned, neglects or refuses to pay for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, property charged against it under subsection (c), the Secretary concerned may bar it from receiving any part of appropriations for the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, as the case may be, until the payment is made.

(f)(1) Instead of the procedure prescribed by subsections (b), (c), and (d), property issued to the National Guard that becomes unserviceable through fair wear and tear in service may, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sold or otherwise disposed of after an inspection, and a finding of unserviceability because of that wear and tear, by a commissioned officer designated by the Secretary. The State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, whichever is concerned, is relieved of accountability for that property.

(2) In designating an officer to conduct inspections and make findings for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall designate—(A) in the case of the Army National Guard, a commissioned officer of the Regular Army or a commissioned officer of the Army National Guard who is also a commissioned officer of the Army National Guard of the United States; and

(B) in the case of the Air National Guard, a commissioned officer of the Regular Air Force or a commissioned officer of the Air National Guard who is also a commissioned officer of the Air National Guard of the United States.
